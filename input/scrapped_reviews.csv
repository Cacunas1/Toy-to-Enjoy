"1","2","Pros: These Crayons are nice and sturdy feeling, as they are larger than some other brands.The crayons erase easily, even after drying on the wall overnight.Cons: The yellow does not show up on the white surface of a bathtub, so it is virtually useless. The other Crayons are kind of grainy and do not write as smoothly as other brands of bath Crayons. The wax seems harder and the lines the crayons make are narrow and you have to press harder to get a good mark. The crayons also drip a lot and the crayon line on the wall drips if it is moist.I do not think I'd buy these particular bath Crayons again. The quality isn't as good as othersLarger Alex crayon shown on left.Crayons lines on top are Alex -  shown under is another brand."
"2","5","We have ordered these a few times on Amazon, and also purchased in-store, and my now 4.5yr old still enjoys them in the shower! They write on the wall great and wash or wipe off with water. The one drawback for some may be the waxy residual that is left behind on the shower or bath wall. In my opinion, it's not an issue to use a tub/shower cleaner every now and then to clean up that waxy residue left behind but I can understand how that may be an annoyance for other families. Our walls are white so the residual is not really seen but on different types of walls it could be more annoyingly obvious. But, if your little artists would have a blast, do it for the kids! ;-)**Another thought to consider is the color run-off may be an issue for children that are dye sensitive. Also water makes certain colors leech dye, like surprisingly a lot, especially the green and purple, and can even slightly stain fingers if the child holds the crayon (like mine) as opposed to keeping it inside the plastic holder."
"3","4","My son, who is nearly 3, loves these.  He wants to color all over the walls every night at bath time. The colors are bright, except for the yellow which can't be seen on our cream colored tile.  Some people have reported difficulty in removing the writing on the wall.  Sponge or towel does not do so well, but a small loofah will take it off quickly with minimal effort.  I bought a $1 loofah at the store to use for clean up.  Keep in mind that if the tile is wet, the crayons won't work.  The tile must be dry!"
"4","1","These crayons were awful. The color of them on the tub walls looked good, it was bright, but the crayons bled. My son's hand was blue after he used the crayon (in the holder) and it didn't come off that night. I had to soak his hands again the next morning and wash/scrub them with a facecloth for them to not be blue anymore. Needless to say, they went into the trash after the first use. I tried to soak them in a cup for a little while after the bath then drained the cup and left them to dry overnight, tried to use them again the next day before giving them to my son and they bled again. My son was disappointed that his crayons were gone when he only got to use them once."
"5","1","These crayons are not the best. You have to push really hard on the wall to get any pigment. Also, the wall has to be wiped dry or else the water will grab onto the pigment making it hard to draw.Although they have a good price and are big enough for toddler hands, I would not reccomend.I do however recommend the Crayola brand bath crayons because they are far superior to these. They may be a little pricier but the few extra dollars pays off with how many extra colors you get and how well they work."
"6","1","The bath crayons did not work well in the bath tub and only parts of the drawings came out. The toddler couldn<U+2019>t get any color to come out and the preschool age child could get about half her drawing. She gave up trying to write her name after the first letter. Both kids gave up pretty quick. The bath crayons also fell out of the plastic case when turned upside down. Both kids had been excited to use them and I am now looking to order a different kind. Would not recommend"
"7","5","One of 5 yr old's favorite tub toys! He is in Pre-K, and loves to practice writing his letters and numbers. He also likes it when we write simple messages to him and then help him sound them out while playing in bath. If you worry about staining, it does clean up fine with a little scouring scrub. Most of the time - just wipe. May only compliant - wish they ""crayons"" lasted longer. They store better if you remove from tub or any standing water and place in some type of draining basket or mesh net. For creativity - even in the bath - plus motor skills, I recommend!"
"8","5","To be honest when I purchased these I was a little unsure. They have been used by a 5 year old and a 1 year old and they both had the best time in the bath with these! they are easy to use once wet and can go an skin, cloth and bathtubs! So much fun! They are being used also to draw in bowls then to clean them off! This is the perfect way for your little one to help without making a mess! I love these and they work super well!"
"9","3","I bought these for our curious little guy to play with in the tub. They work alright although they wash away easily with even a splash of water. Don't plan on creating any complicated works of art with a splashing toddler. Also, some of the crayons weren't stuck well in their holders. I keep having the red and purple fall right out. The ones that don't fall out are difficult to adjust in length. The sliding button gets stuck. We use them on the tub and mirror to write silly messages and faces, but I don't think I'll be ordering more."
"10","2","The first use was terrific, bold color and relatively easy clean-up for the tub and skin. The next day, noticed all the crayons had drained some of their color out (red definitely became pink), even after we shook out their water before storing them in their tray. Second use was ok, but this time even more of their color drained out, coloring the water itself. That wasn't bad actually, it was entertaining. But these are really now just waxy sticks whose color is hard to wash from skin, after 3 uses."
"11","5","We were in desperate need of new bath toys to keep our toddler entertained long enough to want to stay in the tub longer than a minute. I bought these for one of her stocking suffers and she knew what they were right away and asked me to take a bath right then. They worked like a charm. She had so much fun drawing all over the bathtub and the clean up was super easy. All I had to was splash water at the wall and wipe it down."
"12","3","I have been buying these crayons for over 2 years now and the problem I find with them is that although I've always bought the ALEX brand sometimes they are fabulous and sometimes they're rubbish... either they make them in different factories or buy them from different tollers or who knows, but I can tell specially from the purple color when they will last or not. The set that comes with the purple crayon that looks more like magenta are the cheap ones: these will fall of their holders, will waste if left in the tub (for 2 mere minutes) and will even have the color bleeding out of the wax and draw terribly... the set that has the purple crayon that does look a bit more like violet is great, it will last until the crayons have been used up, in they holders and in full color. The problem is that if you buy it online you wont know which set you will get until they've arrived...I recommend buying these in a store and checking the purple crayon!This is true of all the set (the one with the plastic fish holder, the one with the duck sponge and the set that only has the crayons)good luck"
"13","3","Updated review:After buying the Alex ""Draw in the Tub<U+00A0>Draw In The Tub Crayons (6)"" crayons a few times, we wanted to give this one by Edushape a shot. Instead of writing a review of the Edushape version, I thought Ill write a comparison between the two to help other customers pick the one that suits them the best.1. The ""Draw in the Tub"" crayons come in two versions although the product description doesnt say so. The cheaper one does come with the sponge ducky cleaner while the expensive one does. The crayons in the expensive packRub a Dub Draw In The Tub<U+00A0>are longer resulting in more crayon write and playtime for the kid. The Edushape crayons are pretty small- about the size of the cheaper Alex version. The ducky sponge cleaner is good to have but once you have one, no point in going for the expensive pack.2. Both crayons come off relatively easily- ""relative"" being the key word. If its erased soon after bath time, it comes off quickly without leaving a mess. If allowed to stay on, it gets harder to remove- occasionally warranting a bathtub cleaner. The Edushape crayons are a trifle harder to clean if you allow them to stay on for a day compared to the Alex version.3. The biggest grouse I have with the Edushape one is that it crumbles pretty quickly compared to the Alex version. Both sets of crayons are designed for no more than a couple of days of use but when dropped and allowed to stay in a mug of water (yep, my toddler loves doing that), the Edushape crayons disintegrated fairly quickly.4. Both sets of crayons come with 6 colors and they last one to two showers. No more than that. The bigger Alex crayons last for 3-4 days.5. The packaging for both brands is deceptive in that the crayon holder is significantly longer than the crayon itself. The crayon holder is also pretty useless in holding the crayon intact. Not sure whats the real point behind the crappy holder design for both products.6. A minor quibble with the Edushape crayons is that two of the colors- purple and yellow are so light that it requires special lighting to be spotted on a cream/white tub. I wish they chose darker colors instead.Overall, both products are less than satisfactory but given the choices or lack of it in this segment, one gets to choose either of the two and go with it. I wish there was a third brand that truly created better bath crayons for kids. Seeing how much my toddler enjoys it, I would gladly pay more for a better product!Original Review:We used to purchase this product at our local Target stores. They sold the bigger unit with the eraser ducky. That crayon was better built and came for 2-3 bath sessions. Unfortunately Target discontinued the product for whatever reason. I was forced to look for online purchasing options and found it at Amazon. This specific product is inferior to the one that used to be sold at Target for multiple reasons:1. It is smaller and also waxes off pretty quickly. I was lucky to get it through one full bath session.2. It is about the same price as the bigger one.3. Does not include the ducky which while not being the greatest of crayon cleaners, did the job decently.All in all, less for more. I wish they had the other product also for sale on amazon for the original price.Also, there are no viable and meaningful alternatives to consider in this segment. The Crayola ones are round and ungainly for toddlers to handle comfortably."
"14","3","My daughter loved these first day she used them. Second bath day and we found the crayons ruined. They swelled up from being in water ( I had left them in the tray and water must have gotten in the tray.) I say part of it is user error for leaving them in water on accident. Could not use them a second time. They are completely done after a night of water exposure."
"15","4","These are great! My 15 month old is into scribbling and these are the reason she sits nice in the bath now. They are easy fo wash off the walls as well. My only annoyance is the crayon part comes out of the holder of you hold it upside down so picking them up and putting them back in takes some time and my toddlers fingers are rainbow from holding the crayon directly rather than the holder. I would recommend these though"
"16","5","ALEX toys bath crayons are the best ones for bath time. Note that the set that comes with the holder is different than the set that has just crayons. The first are more oily and can be used dry/cool, the crayons in this set need to get wet/warm in the water first to be able to really use them, but after that they are awesome!"
"17","1","My 2 Year old loves these, however, they don't last past a week. The crayons constantly came out of the holder and if they sit in the water too long they get so soft that they just fall apart. Also, they are all almost all white and the color is gone from them. He got these in his Easter basket and they are just junk. Wouldn't recommend these whatsoever."
"18","3","The dye bleeds and takes a couple days to come off skin.  They don't write well if they get into the water so you have to keep them dry but my toddler like to use them nonetheless."
"19","1","These tub crayons are awful! They don't draw but they melt in water! So they are the opposite of what they should be. Total garbage! Which is where I threw them. I am sorry I didn't read the reviews first. I will stick with crayola. Lesson learned."
"20","1","Terrible. We've had much better bath crayons. These one are falling out of their case and falling apart with any little touch. The crayon writes watery as well. Very disappointed."
"21","1","I had to get out the bleach and scrub my bathtub to get this off. And we didn't get any on the walls or tiles or grout. I'm only talking about the tub itself."
"22","2","Crayons were a big hit but these ones broke off easily (and maybe that's user error) but then I had a very hard time pushing the lever up to move the crayon up - like, I can't and I'm a grownup, on any of them.  Kinda defeats the purpose"
"23","3","The crayons always fall out of the plastic holder. On their own, the crayon pieces are about half the length of the plastic holder9and slippery when wet!), so they are hard for little hands to hold."
"24","5","These are great. We let my daughter use them to draw on the outside of the tub as potty training entertainment.They wipe off really easy with a baby wipe even after sitting a few days. I have zero complaints.Some of the crayons arrived damaged in many original order but they were very promptly replaced"
"25","5","These work pretty well. The plastic holder is genius and a huge improvement from the old style with no holder. They work better on dry walls. we have a white plastic / fiberglass tub enclosure , so no grout and no staining."
"26","4","My girls lov to color in the bath.  These are easy to use and are super bright and colorful.  My only complaint is that they wear out so quickly, especially if they hang out on water too much - the soap breaks down quite fast."
"27","2","These fall out of the plastic tubes easily and don't stay in if you put them back.  They are not as easy to wash off the tub as the Crayola brand.  The colors are as vibrant either.  I'd recommend if you are going to spend the money get the Crayola ones."
"28","1","Totally disappointed with these, chucked them in the trash after the first use...didn<U+2019>t write well, fell out of hold once in warm bath water"
"29","1","These are awful. The munchkin brand are pretty great. My 16mo daughter loves them. The crayons still fall out of the plastic, just like these, but at least they draw. These do absolutely nothing right. Don't waste your money."
"30","3","My daughter likes it, that is why I give it a three, but they do not last long, for me only lasted a week and crayons became very brittle and fell apart. If you don't mind buying them frequently then not a bad product."
"31","3","These were alright but they disovled kinda quik. I think they lasted 4 baths. They did clean up very easy. I think that f you could get them to you 1 at a time and keep them dry unless they are using them. They were pretty neat."
"32","2","The color bleeds in the bath and stains my sons hands...and they get flimsy. The color isn't brilliant either. Wouldn't buy again."
"33","2","These don't write well, the colours don't show up if there is any water on the surface (highly likely, during a bath!). Hard to move the base up when the crayon tip gets worn down. Buy a different brand!"
"34","1","These are not like other bath crayons I have bought at all.  The crayons constantly fall out of the tube and they bleed everywhere. They also stain."
"35","2","Didn't last long at all. If you let them fall into the tub the colors start bleeding."
"36","1","Poor quality. The crayons kept falling out of the holders and they are slimy and nasty when they come out of the tub. My daughter enjoyed them and they were easy to wipe off. But that doesn<U+2019>t make up for the awful quality."
"37","3","Pushing the crayons out of the tube is quite difficult... great while it lasted, but I threw them out once the tips had worn down because getting the rest of the crayon out of the tube was horrendously hard."
"38","4","The bathtub crayons work but it's very difficult to extend the crayons in their plastic case. This is why I give them a four-star rating. On the plus side extremely easy to wash off the tub and walls!"
"39","1","These were terrible. The <U+201C>wax<U+201D> is really hard, making them difficult to use. I left one in the water for a few hours, and afterwards it dried out and crumbled. They<U+2019>re also really difficult to clean off the tub walls, leaving a faint stain where they<U+2019>ve been. I ended up throwing a couple away without even using them."
"40","1","These are absolute junk. I was so careful with these crayons, taking them out after each bath so they wouldn't get crumbly and soggy. Nothing worked. The tips broke off on the second use and the rest of the crayons are stuck in the plastic tube. I took a screwdriver and a few other things just trying to move the plastic piece and the rest of the crayon up, but they are all stuck in the plastic tube. Really disappointed."
"41","1","Not nearly as good as the crayola bath crayons. Hardly colored. Washed out color when left in water. Buy crayola ones from target. Same price, way better product. Also, there are 10 in the crayola pack"
"42","2","My daughter has a blast with these! Covered the whole tub in crayon. Then we went to use them again the next night and couldn<U+2019>t push the crayon up. If you leave them in water too long the crayon seems to absorb the water making it impossible to push them up. She now has to stick her finger in the crayon to get any out. Another product from amazon that didn<U+2019>t work for her for Christmas. Two stars only because she still has fun with it."
"43","5","My daughter hated bathtime until I got these! Now she has so much fun coring all over the tub. The crayons are easily cleaned from surfaces and don't stain."
"44","1","wasnt happy with this product, they did not stay in the holder so they fell loose in the bath water, you could barely see the coloring on the tub.  dont waste your money"
"45","3","My son loved these but they only lasted for two baths. Make sure to not submerge them in water and to store in dry location or they crumble"
"46","1","These did not write well and were a challenge to clean off. They stained our white vanity top. Do not recommend & will not purchase again."
"47","2","Don't leave these in the tub between baths - the color runs and makes a GIANT mess.  Good thing my kids think scrubbing the tub with a sponge to clean it off is fun.  Also, the crayon part didn't stay in place in the outside plastic holder - so my toddlers couldn't really use them well.  Not worth the mess."
"48","3","They were fun while they lasted. My son (3) was able to break the crayon part quickly from pressing too hard when he drew."
"49","3","The kids love this product.  There is cleanup required as they leave a film on the tub.  All around a great product aside from the cleanup.  If your kids are older though, they love to help."
"50","3","These were great until the got wet and stopped coloring, then fell apart. Better price on name brand at the store and better quality."
"51","2","These crumbled and fell apart in the tub- also we could not get the clicker pushed up to push out the rest of the crayon on most of them. These were a one time use product and a waste of money."
"52","3","do not leave in water for a long period of time or they just dissolve and scrub off tube after each bath or the marks are harder to remove later on."
"53","2","These were okay for a few uses. Do not leave them submerged in water they will crumble. I would not buy again."
"54","1","This stained our new grout and in general it<U+2019>s not as easy to remove as I would have liked. I had to throw them away after one use."
"55","5","My daughter loves coloring in the tub and these are perfect, although the crayon falls out of the plastic holder too easily!!"
"56","1","These crayons are a disappointment. They say that they are easy to clean off, but what they mean to say is that the pigment rinses away very quickly, even in the crayon itself. What was once a beautiful purple, is now a lavendaf. What was once a vibrant orange is now a muted sherbert. The bold blue is now a sky blue. Yellow is pretty much non existent."
"57","1","These are only half crayons -the other half is a case. 3 came broken ..way to make a 2 year old sad"
"58","5","We have always had good luck with the Alex tub crayon.  This is my 4th set.  My daughter loves them.  They do not stain my tub if I wipe it down right after bath time with a sponge.  I have tried the crayola once before and those did stain my tub.  The colors in this set are not as vibrant as the crayola ones though and the colors are limited to 6.  Well worth the money for any tot."
"59","1","These are terrible. The crayon part doesn't stay in the holders at all, they are very slippery and when they try to write on the tub they crumble apart in pieces. Worthless don't waste your money."
"60","1","Really bummed with how awful these were. One time use and they fall right out of the pen holders."
"61","3","Not so impressed with these crayons. I had a set of similar ones which my daughter loved and used till the very end. Bought these and they don't color as well and they leak their color when stored"
"62","3","To make the colors pop up is very hard.. they last a long time but the adjusters are a pain in the but."
"63","5","My son is OBSESSED with these!! (21 months old) will definitly be ordering more.. easy clean up and hours of entertainment !"
"64","2","These crayons fell apart in the tub once they hit the water. I would not recommend these."
"65","2","These don't stay in the holders, they melt in the water, overall I wouldn't buy again"
"66","1","The first time use of these was great. But the second time was a fail. The color seems to have all drained out of the crayons after the first use. I won't purchase these again. A one time use for the price, it's simply not worth it."
"67","5","My granddaughter is going to love writing on the bathroom walls with these."
"68","1","These are the worst!! They don<U+2019>t write worth crap and they fall out of their holders. You would be better off taking your $5 and throwing it in the trash because that<U+2019>s basically what you<U+2019>ll be doing with these crayons."
"69","4","We LOVE this product except the yellow is not dark enough to color with. I would buy again. Have recommended to many people."
"70","2","These were so gross and left crumbs ( for lack of a better word) all over bathtub"
"71","1","most of the color drains from the crayon when wet, which stains the bath water. very hard to use when damp (aka defeats the purpose of bathtub crayons). plastic casing does not hold crayon and they slip out frequently with use. would not purchase again."
"72","3","These are kind of crappy. They don't really draw on the tub and I'm not going to let my kid draw on the tile and potentially stain the grout. And the crayon parts are always falling out of the holders. Should've gone for the better brand."
"73","1","Poor quality, no color, kid was frustrated. Munchkin are FAR better."
"74","1","We used these twice. By then they had dissolved or fallen apart. They came out of the holder easily and left our hands green."
"75","5","These are solid for any kid to play with and be occupied with bath time"
"76","2","The crayons kept falling out of the plastic holder. Couldn<U+2019>t get them to stay in. Easy to clean up tho"
"77","1","The kids have a lot of fun with these. But they stain the grout and tub if it has matte finish."
"78","3","The crayons keep falling off the plastic holders. They do work on bathtub and tiles but they loose their external colour when in contact with water dying water and staining the bathtub. But they still keep their drawing color and its easy to clean."
"79","3","The only problem is that the plastic piece easily detaches from the colored wax."
"80","5","This is our third time buying these. Makes a great stocking stuffer. Can be a little hard to clean off if the kid draws firmly."
"81","4","These are a little tough to wash off compared to other brands i've used in past."
"82","2","We only used this three times before it was broken to bits."
"83","5","They bleed when wet, but the marks come off the wall easily and let my neice play in the tub"
"84","3","They work. The crayon part fell out of the holder on some. And the color wasn't super strong in some colors. You get what you pay for! For a bath toy though, they were fine."
"85","3","The crayons fall out of the casing very easily and the colors, once wet , get all over the child's hands and body without the casing. Good idea just not thought through very well. Writes on wall and tub  easily and colorful."
"86","1","These bath crayons are terrible, none of them are great but these are by far the worst. Leak color and lose color in the tub. The crayons ones fall it all the time but the crayon never loses its color or effectiveness. These after one or two baths are essentially a worthless mess"
"87","1","Hard to get off bathtub walls. And certain colors stain walls. Would not order again."
"88","2","The crayons don't stay in the holders. Poorly made."
"89","1","Awful. They just fall out and the whole thing is like food coloring. Stains your hands."
"90","2","Our first crayon (blue) got completely jammed and is no longer usable/adjustable. In addition, the blue crayon dyes my daughter<U+2019>s skin. Haven<U+2019>t tried the other colors yet, but they seem hard to adjust as well. Bath crayons we<U+2019>ve gotten in the past have been easier to adjust and less likely to dye skin."
"91","1","We got about two trips to the tub before these simply dissolved into little flecks that were hard to wash out of the tub."
"92","1","Didn<U+2019>t love this brand. They didn<U+2019>t hold up like other brands we<U+2019>ve had before and I ended up throwing them away about a week after we received them because they all broke super easily and the colors weren<U+2019>t very bright. Also- they<U+2019>re a lot harder to clean off than others we have had"
"93","5","My nephew loves to use these in the bath tub."
"94","5","My niece absolutely loved these! Got them as a gift and she didnt wanna come outta the tub! she was able to draw a lot with them and we always loved her projects. makes ya wanna get them for yourself as an adult since its easy to wash away! haha"
"95","1","I could't wait to get these for my son. Was disappointed when it was just the tip of the crayon that you get, not the whole crayon."
"96","5","Great to use, my 3 year old and 1 year old can both use them!"
"97","3","These color ok but don<U+2019>t last long"
"98","5","These are less messy than bathtub paints, and the retractable color sticks make it easy to put them away without making a mess. You do need to teach your children not to leave them floating in the bathtub, or they will dissolve over time and come off the base.If you leave the kids too long in the tub with these there WILL be a bathtub ring. Wipe it off ASAP, it only gets harder if you let it dry."
"99","4","Decent enough. The crayon part easily falls out, which is annoying, but the wax is easily wiped off (at least from my tub). Probably won<U+2019>t buy again, but I<U+2019>d say we got our money<U+2019>s worth."
"100","1","The crayons fall out!!! Cheap..."
"101","1","These wouldn<U+2019>t push up out of the crayon like they are supposed to do we had to throw away all but one pretty quickly. Only one would push up out of the holder. What a waste!!"
"102","1","They get 1 stars because at least they entertained my daughter. I however could not have been more disappointed in the quality. These are onetime use if at all, basically falling apart out of the package."
"103","4","These are super fun! My boys loved them!! I loved how easily it wiped off in the shower and how easy it was to use them."
"104","1","Crayons start to melt pretty quick in the water and then slide out of the plastic holder which then, my child places into her mouth.  But she was only one, almost two and I monitor bath time 100%.  So maybe better for older kids."
"105","3","These crayons  fall apart super easy work nice in the bathtub"
"106","3","A little disappointed with these. The colors are bright and my son still uses them, but they do dry out between bath times and crumble. Would not recommend."
"107","1","To waxy does not work"
"108","2","These don't hold up well. Very hard to push up to get more to draw with. Even with a screwdriver I had problems. Just turn to mush."
"109","1","They didn't color like they should have.  They leaked (I guess this might be the best word to use) or dyed the water.  And right out of the package they were falling out of the holder.  Would NOT recommend."
"110","1","I went for a cheaper option for bath crayons - and threw these away the second day we had them.  Compared to the brand name bath crayons we bought in the past, these don't write well (at all) and broke on first use.  Not worth the money, even if they are cheap."
"111","5","I can't get my son out of the tub when we pull these things out! They wash off really easy too if you are concerned with that."
"112","2","I found they didn<U+2019>t write very well on the tub"
"113","5","Best art supplies for the bathroom by far and come off easily."
"114","3","Daughter loved this product but it has stained our grout in the bathroom a little. Not sure what cleaning product will get it out completely  - what I have tried hasn<U+2019>t worked yet."
"115","4","They wash off super easy but they do stain if you dont get it off next to right away."
"116","3","Color well and easy to clean but the crayons push down in the plastic shell when being used and need to be pushed back up. If submerged in water they melt and become mushy very fast."
"117","5","These are great, not sure why there are some negative reviews. Of course they bleed when wet....they are crayons! However, it comes right off of the tub and bath toys when my son draws on them. I could let him walk around all day and draw on everything and clean it up within minutes."
"118","4","Gift"
"119","3","I can't speak about the actual use of these crayons since they were a gift but I know that they were very well received.  My only gripe (if you can call it that) is that these seem awfully overpriced for what you get.  The packaging does not look impressive at all.  Again, this doesn't matter to 99% of the people reading this (who are planning on buying these for their own kids) ... but it might help those considering giving this as a gift :)"
"120","2","Other brands are better. These are very waxy and hard to use"
"121","5","Arrived on time and as described"
"122","1","Crayons don't wipe down well and if they are stored with even as little water they get gross."
"123","3","Stains kids hands"
"124","1","I would not buy these again. They crumbled in the water and lasted maybe 3 baths. Also they come in these plastic containers that aren't designed well."
"125","2","Stain and difficult to remove rven right after has been used. Crayola's are much better quality and have better performance"
"126","1","She didn't care for them, didn't work very well. Would drop whatever color every where .... I don't think it's worth it ."
"127","1","Don't waste your money. Crayons fall out of the plastic holders and don't write well on the bathtub. My son used one for 5 seconds and wouldn't touch them again. You're better to make shaving cream paints! Much more fun."
"128","5","Thank you"
"129","4","These are cool. They feel a little wasteful with all the plastic involved. They kinda get used up very quickly."
"130","1","Stained mine and my daughters hands. Melted in contact with water creating a huge mess."
"131","5","For the kids. You know how that goes.  Give them anything that makes a mess or makes lots of noise."
"132","1","Stained my tube, had to scrub to get all the colors off."
"133","1","My toddler broke them as soon as they came out of the package. The colors hardly show up if you try them on the side of the tub. Don<U+2019>t waste your money."
"134","1","It took a lot of elbow grease to get my tub clean after each use."
"135","5","My kids liked these but my oldest saidThey didn't work well once they got water on then"
"136","1","Just fall apart in the water after a few uses."
"137","3","The artwork that is found on the tub with these crayons is actually very difficult to scrub off. They do stain if you leave it on there long. You have to use a strong cleaner to remove it, and a lot of elbow grease."
"138","2","they dissolve in the water"
"139","3","My 4 year old loves these but I assumed I could just wipe the color off the tub, but I found that I really need to scrub."
"140","4","Will be a problem when they run out. Will not take bathes W/O them, now."
"141","1","The crayons came out of their holders immediately. Very cheaply made"
"142","2","the soap crayon does not stay in the holders they are too small and constantly fall out into the bath water"
"143","1","not worth the money did not work at all"
"144","1","DONT BUY!! THEY STAINED MY SHOWER!! The marks won't come off! Stay away!!"
"145","1","My son used these in the tub and they disintegrated in one tub use and now they won<U+2019>t wash off the tub"
"146","5","These work really well to draw in bathtub, wash off easily. Easy entertainment for toddlers and pre-schoolers."
"147","5","Perfect! Thank you!"
"148","1","These fell apart as soon as I gave them to my toddler in the bath the crayon came out and wouldn<U+2019>t stay in holder. Ended up in garbage after one crayon ended up down the drain!"
"149","5","As expected"
"150","1","Did not work and refused to refund. Don<U+2019>t waste your money!"
"151","1","They worked great the first couple of times and then dried and crumbled. I was very disappointed."
"152","1","These make a mess, fall apart easily. Great concept, poor execution"
"153","5","Fun in the tub.  Good price, lasted as long as I would expect."
"154","1","My kids loved these! I did not. Be prepared to scrub your tub forever to get the colors off."
"155","1","Colors do not stay put in the holders."
"156","1","Falls apart easily, doesn't do well in water"
"157","2","These ran everywhere and got pretty gross after about a week."
"158","4","My kids love these but if you turn them upside down the crayon falls right out"
"159","4","Fun for the kids, but the ""crayons"" break pretty easily."
"160","5","Excellent Product, 100% recommended."
"161","2","Did not write well on tub or wall"
"162","3","these are not that great. They melt in water (like in any water, including if your hand is damp), but do not hold up to much pressure when coloring."
"163","1","These Don<U+2019>t actually draw, they just dye the water and clump on the walls of the bath. Literally trash. Avoid at all costs."
"164","5","Last a long time and washes off easily!"
"165","3","Once you use the tip, it's hard to get more of the color, something is stuck there"
"166","1","These bath crayons suck. They crumble when you try to use them and fall out of their plastic containers right away."
"167","1","These do not work. Barely run off on the tub and when they do, it's in little specks.  Really terrible."
"168","1","Mine came completely opened and unpackaged ina box. In addition, I am short one crayon. Very disappointed."
"169","1","THEY DONT RIGHT ON TUB IF ITS WET<U+2026>.."
"170","5","My son loves these"
"171","5","She enjoyed them a lot! However I would like refills if possible because the crayons go fast."
"172","5","granddaughter loves this"
"173","1","Absolutely horrible. We usually use the crayola tub crayons and have had no issues with their ability to be cleaned off the surface of our tub with out staining.  We purchased these because the crayola crayons were a little more expensive and we thought we would give them a try.1.) They don't show up nearly as vibrantly as the Crayola bath tub crayons.2.) They crumble apart even when wet.3.) They stain the shower walls. Which i suppose is fine if you want to forever preserve your toddlers masterpiece...  and never move.DO NOT BUY THESE!"
"174","1","Super disappointed with this product. Crayons have been used twice and they are all crumbled and even I can't move them up to allow more of the crayon to be exposed. There is no way a child could do it."
"175","1","Didn't stay in holders and just kinda melted right away"
"176","5","18 month old grandson loves these!"
"177","1","These are not child friendly. My two year old was able to pull the crayon out of plastic case in a minute"
"178","3","Color is pretty light when you draw and they are super messy, leaving streaks of color all over my tub. They clean up easily but I think I bought a different brand last time and they were much better :/"
"179","1","The crayons didn't stay in their holders well at all, and they were just a mess. We ended up throwing them away after two uses."
"180","2","They're ok. When they get wet they kind of fall apart. Not worth the price."
"181","5","kids love it, washes off well.... wold recommend"
"182","5","my daughter loves!"
"183","1","These are terrible! Crayon doesn<U+2019>t stay in outer cartridge... didn<U+2019>t even last 1 bath!"
"184","1","These crayons did not even last one bath. The crayons fell out of the casing and started melting. They also do not write on the bathtub. Very disappointed in these."
"185","4","I got these for my granddaughter.  She loves them"
"186","1","These are the worst! They're bath crayons that only work when dry, and all the color washes out of them if you leave them in the bath water for more than a couple of minutes. I've never written a review of anything before, but I feel like people need to know that these crayons are awful."
"187","2","Did not work ber well"
"188","5","These are awesome. My daughter loves them, and they clean up easily- even after leaving them for several hours :) the colors are bold and stay on tub walls well until splashed."
"189","2","Once water gets in it the crayons expand and are useless."
"190","5","Love these"
"191","3","The button was hard to elevate to bring the crayon to the top. I couldn<U+2019>t even do it for a few. Won<U+2019>t purchase this brand again."
"192","4","Lotsa fun in the tub!"
"193","5","Pain to clean off bathtub sometimes, but absolute fave for my toddler. Need to buy more."
"194","2","I really liked the idea of these, but all the crayons fell out within minutes of taking them out of the package. The color bleeds out quickly as well. I expected crayons for the bath to last longer than 2 uses."
"195","1","These lose all their color after a couple uses...and if there is any water left on or around them, they bleed all over and end up just white wax sticks."
"196","1","These worked okay at first, but the crayons are encased in a plastic tube and it is nearly impossible to roll the crayon up once the exposed tips are gone. Highly frustrating. Cheap piece of crap."
"197","4","Lol if you have hard water don't use this in your tub.. it doesn't come off :)"
"198","2","These crayons are very difficult to get off of the tub. If you have a porcelain tub, stick with paints instead of crayons."
"199","4","Good for 2 yr old"
"200","5","Our daughter adores these bath crayons, and they stay in the holders a little better than some of the other brands we've tried. Plus it has purple, which is awesome. I love anything that fosters her creativity, so this definitely fits the bill."
"201","3","The crayons don't stay in the plastic holders"
"202","5","The crayons are great and the shipping time was great."
"203","1","crayons break and don<U+2019>t write clearly... fade away easily."
"204","1","Terrible . They dont even write on the walls"
"205","4","Break and crumble very easily but my kid still loves them. Cleans off easily."
"206","1","They didn't last at all. They came out of the plastic holder n melted in water"
"207","3","The crayon falls out"
"208","2","These dissolve when the toddler drops them in the water."
"209","1","I didn't read any reviews of these - I just wanted to get some tub crayons for my 2-year-old and I think these were the cheapest ones that were prime eligible.  I'm not sure what the purpose of the holder is - they should've just made the crayons a little fatter and they'd work great.  The crayons themselves are super skinny and only last a couple of baths.  I definitely don't recommend them."
"210","1","Terrible quality! I just received them and they 1. Fall apart and 2. Barely write. Do not buy!"
"211","4","My kids love these"
"212","1","Awful quality. Would not even write in tub and then turned the water all different colors which combined was brown and freaked out my 2 year old."
"213","2","I have a 2 year old and she loves to color so I bought these. They work fine except they do fall out of the holders and they are hard to clean off the tile unless you scrub. The darker colors stain her skin so once she is done playing we have to wash all over. I would never buy these again."
"214","1","They practically dissolve once you start using them and do not color very well especially when the wall is wet [which defeats the purpose since the walls are inevitably going to be wet in the shower]. Crayola brand is much better i will stick with them from now on."
"215","1","These are awful, don't waste your money. First of all, the crayons do not write well on the tub. Second, the crayon part constantly falls out of the plastic casing. Very cheap."
"216","1","Horrible... some of the crayons are falling out and they don't draw as nicely as advertised"
"217","1","These crayons were more wax rather than actual bathtub crayons. They barely wrote and when they did it had to be scrubbed off very aggressively. I threw them all away."
"218","1","Unless your child takes a bath dry, these are not intended for the bath tub. They do not write when wet or on wet surfaces. They also bleed horribly on the skin, not what you want when the objective is getting clean."
"219","3","These are so much fun to use on the shower walls or on the mirror (even for adults!). I wish they were bigger and longer though, they get used up too quickly."
"220","5","This was bought for my niece. She loves drawing in the bath tub, but she had been using this weird soap crayons, they didnt draw very well, when she started to play with these they actually draw on the wall and comes off with ease. She loves it!"
"221","1","The write great on the bathroom walls but the crayons just fall out of the plastic holder they are in.  Absolutely TERRIBLE design!"
"222","5","Great stocking stuffer."
"223","1","Terrible. Unlike others we<U+2019>ve had these leaked everywhere for some reason. I thought their being in a cylinder would make them a neater toy and they are not. We threw them away."
"224","1","Package arrived damaged & open with only 1.5 crayons. Very strange."
"225","2","Crayons are hard to push out and fall apart when they get wet"
"226","5","These are my daughters favorite toy. If I say bath time she screams COLORSSSS!!!! (She<U+2019>s almost 2)"
"227","4","My daughter (17 months) has found a reason to stay in the tub! She loves the crayons, as does my 6 year old. So fun and easy to wash off."
"228","1","Not cool! I bought these for my son to use at bath time. You'd think they would wash right off with a little water and soap-- nope! Scrub until your sponge falls apart and the crayon will still be stuck to the walls of your tub."
"229","1","Crayons arrived with mold on them."
"230","1","These were awful.. They all fell out everytime he tried to color with them. Very cheaply made"
"231","5","A toy from my past, I had to get it. My nephew is over at my place on weekends, he loves baths had to get them. I am passing on love of writing in the tub."
"232","1","The other reviews are correct in stating that the crayons don't stay in the holders that they come with.  Fine.  We took them out.  I gave my son two and I took one for myself so I could show him how they work. I wrote his 6 letter name on the side of the tub and the crayon was half gone!  They crayons were dissolving in the water!  What a waste of money.  Fortunately I had also purchased the Crayola tub markers.  Those are much more durable."
"233","2","Very messy and dyes the water. Not easy to remove."
"234","1","These do not work well at all for tub. Had a different brand before that worked much better. Once the water hits them they run and crayon washes off."
"235","1","These crayons did not last long at all and it became impossible to extend the crayon out of the cover.  Poor design"
"236","1","The crayons fall out of the tubes and then won't draw while wet. It didn't even last through one bath tub. Total waste of money. If I could return them I would."
"237","1","Melts in the tub within 10 minutes"
"238","1","the crayon part falls out of the holder, and you have to press really hard to get the crayon to draw on the tub."
"239","1","I only gave it a one star because I had to, they melted the first time my grandson used them. Not worth getting even if they were free."
"240","1","These bath crayons melt if they are in the water. Didn<U+2019>t even last a week. All the crayons popped out of the holder..."
"241","1","These crayons were very difficult clean off the tub and also very difficult to get any color to come off the crayon when using it. I would not recommend these to anybody."
"242","5","A little tough to wash off of the walls, but overall I<U+2019>m satisfied!"
"243","2","These crayons did not work very well.  They don't write on wet walls, and get mushy when wet for too long.  I would not recommend, but you get what you pay for..."
"244","2","The colors were awesome the first try my daughter loved them. Second time she went to use them? The crayons were white and it was difficult to use. The crayons also smush when you press (which you have to to write) and bits of crayon get everywhere. And if the wall is wet at all it won<U+2019>t write on it. Seems like someone needs to go back to the drawing board."
"245","4","Nice works better than the markers. Only fault is they<U+2019>re easy to break"
"246","1","Bought these for my son for Christmas, he loves bath time so I figured bath toys would be great. They arrived today and it appears mold or something is growing on the green crayon. Sending them back."
"247","2","Hard to move up when the tip breaks."
"248","4","I bought these as a gift for my 6 year old granddaughter who loves baths and to draw.  A 2 in 1 gift.  She enjoyed them so much, she  used them up in 3 baths.  My daughter said the first time they were used KT was so quiet everyone thought she fell asleep in the tub...then she let out a yell.  When the family ran to the bathroom they were delighted to see a wall of art work.  KT was so proud and she did not want to leave the tub.  My daughter said the clean up was done in seconds with the hand shower.  Thank you"
"249","1","We have had many bathtub crayons, and there is a wide range of quality out there.  These are some of the worst we have used.These are quite water soluble and ""melt"" all over the place.  They don't write very well at all.  And after a short time, the crayon part falls out of the plastic holder.So - do yourself and your kids a favor and try a better brand."
"250","1","This item crumbles, flakes and breaks when used in the bathtub.  Order a different product"
"251","5","The product is very good"
"252","1","They break, and don<U+2019>t color easily."
"253","1","The crayons crumble if left in water too long"
"254","2","Colors leak out of the crayons and hard to draw on tub with.. will stick with crayola"
"255","5","Great incentive for bath time"
"256","3","The package came partially open..."
"257","1","These are horrible! The first time we put them in the tub the dye ran and the crayons were white. Couldn't use after that. Worse product I have ever used. Don't waste your money."
"258","1","These things are horrible and not worth a penny. Of both sets I bought, the first set completely all fell out of the holders and were horrible. The second set also fell apart. Will never order these again."
"259","3","Sharp ends on these! Lots of them, which us goid, but narked 3+ Years. We'll still ise them but with caution."
"260","1","These do not work! You can NOT see the color on the tub. Very very disappointed."
"261","5","My son loves these!"
"262","1","We couldn<U+2019>t push the crayons up, all of them were stuck. Won<U+2019>t buy it again."
"263","1","doesnt wash off, had to buy a magic eraser. I threw them away... DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
"264","1","Doesn't draw very well my daughter has to use all her force to make it color. Sigh."
"265","3","After the crayons get wet they crumble and break apart"
"266","1","They fall apart 1st time you try to use them!!"
"267","3","would probably be better with older kids, my kids 3 and 2, would just push the crayon all the way out of the plastic and break them off, should of bought solid crayon ones."
"268","4","I think they're great and so does my son, who has been using them since he was under 1 year - he's 22 months now.  Much better than any soap crayons.  the price is so cheap, i don't see how anybody can have a problem with them."
"269","5","great bath toy"
"270","1","Disappointing...They do not work for writing in the bath."
"271","1","Do not purchase. Not only did these not work but they stained my tub. I threw them away. Go with Crayola. Very disappointing."
"272","5","It didn't cost a lot and it helps my granddaughter to take a bath without a problem."
"273","1","Love to draw in the tub, but these crayons don't last very long on the tub - they wash away immediately... Also, if you leave the crayons in a wet area, they begin to crumble. These are not worth the time or price - you should find another tub crayon."
"274","4","These were so fun. They wash off fairly easy but I will say, the waste very fast."
"275","1","Crayons disolved after one bath, will not buy again"
"276","5","Ensure you have a drain-able storage device.  If these sit in water, they will lose their color."
"277","1","These stained everything - including my kid. I took them away after one use....my child was covered in rainbow bath crayon for 3 days...."
"278","5","LOVE THESE!!!"
"279","1","They won't write on wet surfaces and fall out of their plastic holders"
"280","1","Low quality, crayons fall out of plastic holder"
"281","1","Poor quality.  Didn't even last through one bath."
"282","5","perfect"
"283","4","My daughter likes these Tub Crayons and uses them often. It is not hard to erase them off the tub or the tile when cleaning."
"284","4","They do the job and keep the kids happy. Not add pigmented as others we have used."
"285","2","Could be easier to use.These crayons are not bright and the yellow does not show up at all.You really have to press hard to make these work.I Would not recommend these to anyone.There must be some better ones on the market."
"286","5","Always a fun time in the tub!"
"287","1","Not impressed with these at all. They barely draw and leak or bleed all over the place. Wouldn't order again"
"288","1","These are horrible. They are cheap and so hard to open! The bubble stick doesn't work. Waste of money."
"289","3","My daughter liked these.. But the only thing that sucks is if they get wet..they don't write..so..if you have a 3 year old like I do..and they want to play with them.. You will be wiping them off the whole time so your kid can play with them."
"290","1","The tips of the crayons fell out on the first use."
"291","5","Fun for the kids."
"292","1","they don't actually write when they're wet. just sort of clump up."
"293","1","Doesn<U+2019>t show up on wall"
"294","3","Love these but the pieces fall out"
"295","2","They don't stay inside the holders."
"296","1","These leave stains on the tub and all the color runs off the crayon when left in shower. The munchkin crayons are the best. Not these."
"297","2","Yellow does not show up and they fall out of the sleeve.  The red one leaked on a leg and stained it."
"298","4","My son loves these but I wish they didn't fall out of the holders so quickly!"
"299","1","These were garbage. Cheap crayons fell out of case after first use. They barely worked, I bought much better ones."
"300","1","They will stain your tub."
"301","3","They serve the purpose of giving my little guy a chance to color in the tub, and with easy cleanup. However, the crayons fell out of the holder within seconds of each one being used. Out of 6 colors, only 1 remained in the holder.Thankfully it wasn't expensive, but I don't know how many more time he will be able to use it."
"302","1","They run out of color very fast, and one of them got sucked down the drain and clogged our pipe."
"303","3","The crayons do not stay in the holder very well & you have to use some elbow grease to wipe it off the tub. It's also pretty tough to scrub off of a toddlers face."
"304","3","I like the variety of colors but they don't seem to write very well.  They're also very waxy and don't wipe off my (smooth plastic) walls well.  My daughter says she likes the crayola ones better."
"305","5","My daughter loves them"
"306","5","They arrived fast and wash off with no problems"
"307","5","Good product"
"308","1","Dose not come off"
"309","2","I like that your child can draw in the tub but the crayons are constantly falling out of its holder.  They do not hold well and I have already lost quite a few crayons down the drain.  For the amount you spend on the actual item and then shipping, you are better off going to a store to purchase this item."
"310","1","These did not work well in the bathtub."
"311","3","These were great for a few days, but they fell apart once they were too wet."
"312","5","My 3 year old daughter LOVES these tub crayons! They wash off easy! She writes on walls and body during bath. My crayons stay in holders and do not fall out at all. I keep them in a cup on side so they don't melt. I have 2 children that both want the other to wash their hair first. I use the crayons to write on the tub wall the day and who went first so we no longer argue over who had their hair washed first last time bc it is on the wall! Great product!"
"313","5","arrivedo n time and exactly what i wanted"
"314","5","Great fun!"
"315","1","Bought these for my son for Christmas.  After a week (only 2 baths!) all the crayons had come out of the protective sleeves and were broken.  One piece fell down the drain and now our drain is clogged.  The rest were MOLDY after the first week, so we tossed them.  I assumed all bath tub crayons were the same.  They are not.  I would not buy these, I would not recommend them for anyone."
"316","3","I believe that they lasted through about three baths and then were all dissolved.  I don't think that I will be buying this brand again."
"317","1","I would rate this LESS than one star.The colors fall out constantly and they are a royal pain.Child has to pick up loose color and ask for help to reinsert in holder.More time spent on fixing color than having fun coloring.AWFUL product."
"318","1","Terrible. Don't write very well and they crumble easy."
"319","1","These suck. Barely work and the crayon falls out of the container. Honestly wish I could get a refund."
"320","4","Crayons fall out of plastic part easily and break easily too. Fun for a few uses."
"321","5","great"
"322","2","The crayons washed off well but they didn't stay in the holder very well."
"323","1","I returned this, it doesn't work at all. Crappy product"
"324","1","Write horribly, colors bleed in the tub"
"325","4","bright colors!  my daughter had fun drawing in the bathtub with them and washed off easily using a washcloth or wipe!"
"326","1","They don't work!!! Didn't show up at all"
"327","1","I would give it zero stars if possible. These are the worst crayons that we have ever bought for the tub! Crayola are the only ones that have worked great so far. The only downside to crayola is that they are real thin and with a toddler smashing them in the tub they break a lot. But these wont even write in the tub unless it's completely dry and if you submerge them in water the color comes out of them so red is pink and so on. On top of all that the crayon wont even stay in its holder unles pressure is put on the tip. If you are looking to spend 5 dollars on something give it to charity so you can at least feel good about yourself. This company should be ashamed of themselves surely they know all these things and they are selling them anyways. If they dont i would tell them to simply try them for what they are intended for and they can simply see that they are garbage nothing works about them. Either way its a very poor company with no integrity"
"328","5","Good"
"329","5","Love them!"
"330","5","I agree with the users above that the crayons don't stay in the holders.  My advice, don't buy the holders.  My son has been delighted using these crayons in the tub.  They draw easily, are brightly colored, and clean-up in a snap.  The crayons are the best I've seen.  But yes, ditch the holders."
"331","1","these don't work once they get WET.  I realized the last ones we had (and worked great) were munchkin brand instead of Alex so I'll be sure to buy munchkin next time!"
"332","2","Will not wash off easily the white tile. Will not buy again"
"333","1","Dissolved after one bath"
"334","1","Tub crayons are a great toy for the bath, but these ones are smaller than they appear, and less durable than other brands."
"335","2","The crayons fell out of the plastic holders almost instantly (first use).. doesn't come off the bath tub as easily as advertised."
"336","3","Although, the crayons were not what I was expecting (they never stayed in the holders; therefore allowing the color leaked out VERY quickly), my daughter enjoyed the crayons and that is all that matters."
"337","4","I don't know why everyone is complaining about this product. My son loves these tub crayons. Yes they fall out of the cartridges but my son liked using them without them."
"338","4","Have to push hard but we love them!"
"339","1","These crayons do not write well and swell up when wet."
"340","4","We have tried these and the Crayola tub crayons and these are much better. Yes, they do occasionally come out of the holder, but all you have to do is push them back in. These are much softer than the Crayola branded tub crayons. Those flake and are harder to clean. The are smooth and are simple to clean up. Getting ready to order out second set!"
"341","1","Waste of money! Buy crayola! They wouldn't even write on the bath tub"
"342","5","Great"
"343","3","Fell apart after first bath."
"344","1","These crayons are terrible. They break easily and do not stay in the holders. The crayola ones are much better!"
"345","1","These work for a day! :("
"346","5","Great"
"347","1","These water crayons were cheap and poorly packaged. I ordered two for gifts. On one of them, the plastic packaging had come completely off and the crayons were scattered all over."
"348","1","Crayons fall out of holder constantly so my 2 year gets extremely frustrated."
"349","1","The colors kept coming out. They were not what I was expecting."
"350","1","After one use all the crayons essentially melted, leaving streams of colored liquids all over the bathtub."
"351","2","the crayons fall out of the plastic holders and they stain our hands when wet. Thery get very messy and drip color when stored in shower. We used to have the Alex rub a dub star crayon and like that one much more."
"352","1","Would not recommend this product. Did not color smoothly if at all. Crayons broke easily. Was harder to clean up than I thought it would be."
"353","2","Felt like these more or less disintegrated in the bathtub with my daughter. Also it took some pretty hard scrubbing to get it off the bath walls."
"354","1","Cheap and dry rotted. Went right in the trash as they were crumbling in the tub when the kids tried to color!"
"355","2","I'm not a huge fan.  These crayons fall apart after getting wet a few times."
"356","3","I purchased these crayons for my toddler son. So far, we've used them three times at bath time.  We haven't had any problems with the crayons falling out of their holders (as mentioned by other reviewers), but they do tend to bleed on skin very easily. And the orange crayon dyes anything in its path. Once dropped into the water, the entire bath was orange in seconds.They draw nicely however, and serve their purpose. Even though their a bath time item, try to avoid submerging them for any period of time."
"357","2","crayons are short, fall out of holder easily, not refillable. Seems like a rip off. Won't buy again:( Just as other reviewers said."
"358","1","the crayons did not sit well within the individual crayon holders. Was disappointed to lose the doen the sink!"
"359","5","Kids love tjem"
"360","5","Great product"
"361","1","My son had some crayola tub crayons that look like this so I figured they'd be similar... nope! Upon first use these leaked color everywhere, staining the tub and my son's skin. Then they faded in color and upon second use they all fell apart... each crayon detached from the holder."
"362","1","Crayons do not stay in the holder and once they get in the water they dissolve. Plus it stands fingers"
"363","2","Gee, these bathtub crayons work great WHEN THEY'RE DRY, as in NOT IN THE BATHTUB!  We used another brand of bathtub crayons before, and they work great.  These, not so much."
"364","3","My son had tons of fun with these cryons. But, when they started to run out the cryons would fall out of the holders and he would eat them."
"365","3","These fall out of the crayon holder and that drives me nuts.  But they work as bath crayons and last a reasonable amount of time if taken care of.  The color of the crayon can fade if accidentally left in water, but I think that's the nature of the product, not this specific set.  We go through bath crayons quickly, so I like the price of these and will buy them again, even though I'll be frustrated once again with the fact that they come out of the holder."
"366","1","These are the worst bath crayons we have tried, and we have tried many.  The color came out of the holder before I even handed them to my child, crumbled when he tried to draw on the tub, and then wouldn't even leave a mark on the side of the tub (which was dry at the time).  My advice, buy the Munchkin crayons, they have been the best for us."
"367","1","These are really poor tub crayons.  They don't color well.  They are much more fragile than another set of tub crayons that we purchased.  I was excited when we got them due to having more colors than some of the other sets out there, but since none of the crayons color nearly as well as other sets we have purchased, they went in the trash fairly quickly."
"368","1","These tub crayons are not exactly what I wanted. I should have read the reviews closer.Pros- Wide variety of colors.- Wash off easily sometimes.Cons--These crayons are messy. They are very soluble. When my kids were drawing with them, they often wouldn't write, or when it does write it smears and drips down the surface. You wouldn't be able to see what was written within seconds after using them.- Crayons won't write if surface is wet (defeats the purpose of bath crayons!)- Do not stay in holders, break easily- A waste of money because they just don't work.In short I wouldn't buy these ever again! They make such a disastrous mess. I will go back to a more popular brand I used prior."
"369","3","Buyer, be aware, these crayons come half-filled. Kind of a bummer, especially since they dissolve when they come in contact with water."
"370","1","My 18 month old had one in his hand for less than two minutes when he'd already managed to break it (IE separate it from the plastic housing that allows you to extend the crayon).They have to be pressed very hard to write which uses a lot of the item in just a couple strokes.  They don't clean off fully, and the only ones that show up on the even white tiles are the darkest ones.  I would think orange/yellow would still be visible on WHITE tile, but they are barely.Don't waste money on these."
"371","1","Received from toddler's wishlist as an Amazon gift. We have used other bathtub crayons with no problems. These were useless in that the plastic plunger to extend crayon stick did not move. It seems like it was getting slightly tilted inward or stuck underneath the crayon stick and wouldn't budge. Colors worked fine but once the tip was used, I had to throw them away. Also, the yellow should be replaced with a darker color. Bad lighting in most showers and tubs."
"372","1","These were not as bath crayons we have had before. The dye in the crayons had washed out the first day that they were in the tub. The crayons did not stay in the plastic casing and fell out constantly. I will use another brand next time."
"373","2","It's hard to tell in the pictures, but it is a ""crayon"" inside a tube--then as they use it, you are supposed to push it up through the tube. But in reality, it fell out of the tube pretty quick. It also didn't cleanly write on the tub--he would draw a line, and maybe a few smudges of color came off...maybe. It did come off easily."
"374","1","These are just horrible... Let's see... They only write on dry surfaces, and the color bleeds at the mere drop of water. Water easily disintegrates the color, but you end up with smeary, color-stained water running down your tub. In my case it ran down the side OUT of the tub and got into my floor grout and stained it blue. As I was trying to clean it up, I got some of the dye on my hands, and many hand-washings later they're STILL stained blue! I can't believe they're not even washable! I've used 2 different colors with my daughter, and she was frustrated because the crayons kept falling out of the holders, and the pieces themselves are way too slippery/small for tiny hands to hold on to. She seemed excited about using bath crayons in general, so I will try another brand, but AVOID THESE!"
"375","1","worth item i have ever bought its half the cray it looks like inside te cheap breakable plastic and its stains you tub and sink! possible kill your kid with this thing they fell apart into pieces day we bought them had to throw them away. it shouldn't be worth more than 1 dollar"
"376","2","Ok I like that I can control the tip of the ""crayon"" but the crayon part doesn't stay in the tube. Also if left in or near the tub  the color bleeds out."
"377","3","My son loves to color with these in the bath.  Yes, they do not stay in the holders, but it's really easy to pop them out, and the sticks are still long enough without the holder for kids to have fun drawing with them.  I love this set because it comes with a duck clean-up sponge - my son has just as much fun with the sponge as he does with the colors.That said, BEWARE THE PURPLE!!!  All the other colors come off tile/tub/shower surfaces with a quick swipe of the sponge, but the purple just fades.  My tub is now covered in light purple markings despite having scrubbed it several times.  I now throw that color away the minute I get a new package of ""crayons""."
"378","3","These would be nicer if they were all crayon but they aren't. They are actually plastic holders and there is a crayon ""stick"" inside. you have to crank up the crayon part and it falls out easily. Other than that, my daughter enjoys them in the tub. They also clean off easily."
"379","1","I read the bad reviews before buying, but still decided to risk it. I usually don't give 1 star reviews too much credit because maybe that person just had an unusually bad experience, but BELIEVE IT.  I cannot tell you how many ways these crayons stink!:1-to begin, the package was broken open when I received it and one crayon was already out of its holder and wreaking havoc within the box2-the crayon pops back in holder easily, but couldn't even keep them in long enough to hand to my 2 yr old in the bath.3-holders are beyond cheap - such flimsy plastic I didn't even feel bad throwing the holders away before I even got them wet.  They probably decomposed in my bathroom trashcan before the end of the week.4-once outside the holders the crayons all broke in half pretty quickly.5-once wet, the crayons bleed everywhere! You must dedicate a cup to keep the wet crayons in to prevent them from staining your tub, sink, shower curtain, towels, floor, bathmat... Quarantine them immediately after they are wet.  I left them in the tub and they stained all the hairline cracks in the tub blue. I didn't even know i had hairline cracks.  No amount of scrubbing or bleach has removed the staining6-They stain your child!  It took two days for the blue color to be gone from my daughters finger tips and nails after she used the crayon for a couple seconds.7-I threw them out and they stained my trashcan! :(  If you do decide to ignore the reviews like I did, at least take my advice and use a ziploc bag to dispose of them (which you will, shortly after buying them)I know, this sounds like a rant, and I'm not really one to get so angry about a $5 product, but I just cannot believe that this product is actually still being sold.  It is just so so so terrible!Stick with crayola."
"380","1","Well, I made the mistake of not checking the reviews for these tub crayons, on Amazon, before buying on a whim, at our local Target.First off, these crayons do not work, once they are wet.Secondly, the waxy part doesn't stay in the plastic part.Thirdly, they start to fall apart within a weekFinally, they were thrown out within 1 week of using.Previously, we had the Crayola Bath Crayons and I think those lasted us about 6 months. They draw very well and keep together great. Buy Crayola, instead.Don't buy these Alex crayons or you'll just throw money in the garbage."
"381","1","Received these as a gift. They don't write smoothly, begin bleeding immediately, color faded from the crayons after less than 5 minutes in the water. Doubting we'll keep them around for a second use. Will certainly be buying the superior Crayola bath crayons again."
"382","1","They just fall out of their holders the whole time and don<U+2019>t write on the tub very well. It left some marks, but you couldn<U+2019>t consistently create a line or write anything."
"383","4","the crayon doesn't stay in the tube, it will fall out making it hard to color with.  also, the colors are hard to scrub off, so make sure you wipe off at the end of the bath or you will have crayon drawings on your bathtub that do not scrub off easy."
"384","2","The pro with these crayons is that the color rinses right off the tub. All the cons I would have written are already covered extensively by the other reviewers. The crayons don't stay in the holders and the are weak and break once they are taken out of the holder. Also, if the tub is wet, the crayons won't work on the wet surfaces.These were good for one use in the tub and then they went in the trash. Definitely going to get a different brand next time!"
"385","1","I had first purchased my son the Munchkin brand bath cranyons and am really happy with them. I bought Alex brand because they offered an additional color for the same price. I am really unhappy with this product. The cranyons don't stay in the retractable holder and the color literally melts without him coloring. The cranyons are turning a white wax color and I just threw them all away. The munchkin brand does not do this."
"386","3","i bought these at target. Many of the complaints about them are true (they fall out of the holders, they may slightly stain skin, don't write well on wet surfaces). I'll add that they also require scrubbing to completely remove all traces from the tiles. But c'mon people, they cost $6, you can't expect a super high quality product. However, my kid thinks they're AWESOME and that's who i bought them for, so overall I'm happy."
"387","1","These are awful! I've had my eye on them for quite a while and finally decided my daughter was old enough to enjoy them. They only color on dry surfaces, which is a problem when you have a toddler who loves to splash. They didn't write well on the side of the tub, and they didn't write on my daughter's skin - contrary to what the video says. I'm really disappointed and wish I hadn't wasted the money on them."
"388","1","We bought these for my daughter about a month ago and they are really a poor quality product.  They won't write on the tub when there is any moisture on it (which renders these fairly pointless) - furthermore, when you finish the first part of the crayon and try to push up some more, the tip constantly falls back down.  In other words, the little notches you see are not tight enough to keep the tip up.  We bought Crayola bathtub crayons the other day at the store, and they are much better.  The tip actually stays up and they write underwater!"
"389","2","The crayons are not performing well. They do not paint good enough compared to other similar products. Delivery was on time and good packaging."
"390","2","Does not write on the tub, crayons fall out of plastic case. Do not recommend"
"391","1","Crayons were moldy upon arrival (not sure how this is possible??), dissolved when they were dropped in the tub, and dyed my toddler's skin."
"392","5","Period."
"393","1","Packagaing came too damaged to give as a Christmas gift.  Return window closed before I could submit a complaint.  Also disappointed with overall product quality, the crayons seem to run & leak."
"394","1","Can you draw in the bath tub with these crayons? Yes. But ONLY IF IT'S COMPLETELY DRY. Using the crayons on any part of the tub that's been moistened even a little won't work. Since these are purportedly bath time crayons, they completely fail at what they are advertised to do.We have used the Crayola brand bath crayons before and they work great, whether the tub is dry OR wet."
"395","1","absolute garbage, do not waste your money on this."
"396","1","terrible product, they barely color and they melt in the water so the colour goes everywhere. after my sons bath I left them to dry out and I came back to a puddle of colours and it stained the grout. I chucked them in the garbage. worth $8 ive ever spent."
"397","1","I bought these yesterday for my son to play with and they are totally awful!Here are the things that are wrong with this product:1) They don't write on the walls when the tiles are wet (pointless as ""bath"" crayons)2) The crayons fall out of the ""sleeve"" when they are in the water.3) The duck ""eraser"" started falling apart after the first use.I have used Crayola brand ones before and they are much better and also cheaper! Those lasted me for more than 6 months. The Alex ones I just bought yesterday are almost worn out and we just used them once. What a complete waste of money.I also noticed that nowhere on the box does it ever say ""non-toxic"" which leads me to believe that these crayons may not be safe for my child.I will never buy these again."
"398","2","I previously reviewed the other Alex set that comes with the duck sponge. My son got that as a gift and they lasted and didn't melt. Now that my daughter is old enough, I bought a set of these without the sponge for her. They were terrible and melted and wouldn't come up out of the holder. They don't write well on wet tile at all, so what is the point of being able to use them in the tub??? I think they have reformulated the crayons or something because the quality has definitely gone down since 4 years ago."
"399","1","This needs a zero star. The worst money spent. As a parent spend your money on something else..... they all broke after getting wet. Then I couldn<U+2019>t get them to move up. Wasted money....."
"400","2","It draws just like any washable crayon."
"401","1","I read reviews for these crayons somewhere else.  There, the reviewer boasted about how these crayons were better than Crayola's because Crayola's break and these are more durable.  Well, while it is true that none of them have broken, like the previous reviewers said, they fall out of the holders!  My daughter was in a bubble bath coloring with them and all of a sudden there was no crayon in the holder.  We found it and tried to get it back in but it wouldn't stay.  Terrible.  And they are MUCH smaller than they appear to be in the picture.  They only fill about half the holder and they're skinny like a regular small crayon.  Although my daughter thought they were a lot of funny, there must be better tub crayons out there.  I will seek them out."
"402","1","What a disappointment! Very hard to clean from the tiles/bathtub. Color was difficult to clean from my little one's hands."
"403","2","Each crayon comes in a plastic holder.  Each crayon fell OUT of the plastic holder immediately, leaving my child unable to hold onto them.  After putting them back together several times (in one bath), I finally just threw them away."
"404","1","Garbage.  If you want to give your child a bath and then have him be covered in color (he's still holding the crayons and they drip) all over his body, and then have to bathe him again-well then these sure are the bath toys for you.  We threw them out."
"405","5","We are pretty low maintenance when it comes to liking products and I love these crayons. They clean off easy for me (no issues) and my son loves them. :)"
"406","3","They are okay for the price. The crayon falls out of the tube and they dye the water. Super easy to clean up and my kiddos love them."
"407","2","Works well on the tub, however the crayon would fall out of tube.  I probably would not purchase this product again."
"408","1","We bought these crayons for our 22 month old bath lover.  She also really loves drawing.  Perfect combo right?  Well, we purchased these and they are AWFUL.  The colors don't show up and when they do (in weird random streaks) they are really hard to wash off our tile (and the grout is even worse).  We are NOT fans."
"409","1","What a disappointment.  Not only are the plastic holders totally useless because the crayons do not stay in them well, but the crayons all disintegrated within minutes, breaking into small pieces so they couldn't be used at all.  We've used different brands of tub crayons in the past so I wasn't expecting these to be so pathetic and short lived.  Even without the holders, these are a total waste of money.  If I could give it zero stars, I would."
"410","1","super disappointed with this product.  we have loved Crayola bathtub crayons in the past and these just don't hold up.  my kids got them out for the first time today and only 1 of the 4 crayons they used stayed in the holder and the rest broke, were too hard to use, or just plain old didn't really work.  not fun.  will be sticking with crayola in the future."
"411","1","They all broke right away, they stained my son (I had to scrub him raw to get the color off the poor little guy), and they are hard to scrub off the tub too. Worst buy ever, what a waste of money!!"
"412","5","Coll"
"413","1","This was a waste of money!!  I bought these for my daughter Sophie, who is 23 months old, as a Valentines Day gift.  The crayons are very small and the holder makes them appear to be bigger.  The crayons all kept falling out of their holders and my daughter didn't enjoy playing with them.  I WAS NOT IMPRESSED and DO NOT RECOMMEND these to anyone."
"414","1","We have had both these crayons and the Alex bath crayon that looks like a star. Other reviews that say these fall out of the holder are right and it totally defeats the purpose of getting in the tub to get clean. Get the ones that look like a star because the yellow plastic middle allows them to draw without getting it on their hands."
"415","5","Got this as gift for my son and he love a them"
"416","3","My daughter LOVES them so that's a plus, but the crayons always fall out of the holders and get lost in the tub."
"417","1","We adored our original shower crayons (I think Crayola), so we bought these foolishly thinking them to be similar. They are absolutely not. Not only do they fall easily from their holders, but they retain water and thus are swiftly reduced to a mushy paste after a few uses. This makes pushing the crayon up in the holder impossible, as the plunger rising only mushes the crayon out of the front slit instead of pushing it out the top.Absolutely cannot recommend. Try any other brand first."
"418","4","My kids have been playing with these bath crayons for years.  They love them! I have probably been through 15 sets of these things over the years and bought lots of different brands.  They are all the same.  Yeah, they aren't the most durable things.  But they don't care if they fall out of the holder.  They use them without the holders.  I'm just always looking for the cheapest sets.  And good luck finding them at a local store.  I've never been so lucky.  By the way, all the paint sets are horrible. They don't write well.  The crayons are the only way to go.  I just buy 2 or 3 sets each time to offset the shipping costs."
"419","1","I never write reviews but just had to take a few minutes to express my complete dissatisfaction with this product.  My toddlers used it one time and, when we tried to use it again the next day, the crayons had become a huge crumbling mess!  There were crayon chunks all over the bath tub, as the crayons disintegrated before our very eyes.  What a complete waste of money.  It's not terribly expensive but a complete waste nonetheless."
"420","2","They draw fine, but they constantly fall out of the holders."
"421","2","these crayons fall out of their holders easily and quickly dissolve into the water/ and take a little effort to get the color off your hands."
"422","1","I bought these based on the few positive reviews...  Bad decision.  Crayola tub crayons are way better- our last set lasted us quite a long time- where as we just are using these in the bath for the first time tonite and they did all fall out of the holders and are essentially melting in the bathtub.  Not worth the savings.  I'll be buying another set of Crayola.Crayola Bathtub Crayons - Colors will vary"
"423","1","It is really tough to remove the crayons from the tub or tiles.  It takes a ton of scrubbing and I still have color smudges on my white tile.  The crayons are also a bit tough for a small child to get a good grip."
"424","1","Can someone please tell me how to get the ""Rub a Dub Tub Crayons"" out of my grout??? I let my kids use these during bath for the 1st time today.The scrub duck that comes in pkg cleans the tiles fine, but not the grout! Please help!! My white grout appears ruined by these ""tub crayons"". Suggestions appreciated. Thanks!!"
"425","5","But my daughter (3 1/2) has been using them with delight in every bath for the past six months.  On our second set now, and we've never had one fall out.  (And she's pretty high energy in her coloring.)  Only tip I have is to use one of those balls of netting for the bath for cleanup--it takes no time at all (and maybe your kid will want to do it--mine does half the time) and is MUCH easier than a paper towel or cloth."
"426","3","My grandkids love these crayons. They are 9 and 3. They get over their disappointment with the holders right away.  I toss the holders after the first bath.  The big kid draws and the little one wipes it away.I wish, like other reviewers, for more crayon and NO holders!"
"427","1","i did't get these from amazon but still wanted to warn other parents they stink! they wouldn't write on a wet surface and kept falling out of the holder. they were just a total waste of 5$. i had much better luck with the star tub crayon. thankfully we just got another one of those since i had to throw the other ones out after one bath!"
"428","1","Got these along with the ""bath writers"" (see other review) and these were just as disappointing. Didn't even write on the wall with any moisture (you're in a frickin' tub, remember). Stay away from Alex products! Junk! Shameful to waste resources in this way if you ask me."
"429","1","My wife and I bought these for our daughter ( 14 months ) to play with in the tub.... First when we got them we were surprised at how SMALL they really are... and these things dont even fill up the whole holder the come in, not at all like how big they look in the pictures... Second, they WOUND NOT stay in the holder during the bath... they fell out and would not go back in, no matter what we tried. TAKE MY ADVISE, DONT WASTE YOUR TIME NOR YOUR MONEY ON THESE THINGS"
"430","2","These crayons are not worth the investment!  They fell out of the holders on the first use.  They break very easily.  Once they have fallen out of the holders, they do still work however if they rest on the side of the tub, they create a mark and run easily. If the holders worked, they would be a much better purchase."
"431","1","I wish I had read the reviews! I picked these up in a store and they were awful! They all fell out of the holders immediately. They also left a white film all over our bathtub with a 1"" ring around the tub where the water level was. I wish I saw that before I took my son out of the bath because I would have washed him again! They went in the trash after the first use."
"432","5","This was just delivered today and I bought it with the intention that my 4 year old, who loves water and pipes, would play with it in the kitchen sink vs. the bath. We have a little problem with getting him out of the bath so I didn't need any additional encouragement. Anyhow, we opened the box about an hour ago, stood him atop his little step stool and he was in business. The tubes are sturdy and of high-quality. The little fans and flippers add an additional level of entertainment. Plus, the suctions work really, really well - better than those suctions on my toothbrush holder. Plus, the tubes/pipes kind of connect (unintentionally, but my 4 year old is rather inventive so he figured this out by himself) to make more complex structures. Thanks to this today and Amazon's fast delivery, I'm relaxing with a cup of coffee right now as my 4 year old is completely preoccupied with his new ""water machine."""
"433","4","These are pretty cool. They work decently together. They are not see-through like they look in the ad but still a cute bath toy. My 2.5 year old likes them."
"434","3","My 15 month old really loves these. However, after 3 months they now have mold. The mold is in the rubber part where the suction cup attaches to the tube. After every bath the water was shaken off and placed in a dry area out of the bathtub. I can't reach the mold with a q-tip and don't know how else to clean them. I want to give them back to her to play with but need to clean them first."
"435","3","This toy is pretty mediocre. It looked like a lot more fun in the pictures than it is in reality. The pipes could be designed better. Once the pipes are suction cupped to the wall, the trajectory of the water often overshoots the opening of the pipes below, then once the force of the water decreases, it undershoots, Very little water actually goes into the other pipes if you are trying to set up a chain reaction of water flow.You can twist the base of a few of the pipes to change the direction they face, but I found that it really didn't make much of a difference in how much water they were able to catch from pipes placed above them.The colors of your pipes may vary from the picture. All of the same pieces are included though."
"436","2","I am giving this 2 stars because they work partially if they are in the tub.I tried having them stick to the wall tile and no luck, they would fall within 10 seconds, I tried it on a different tile material in the kitchen and the flooring and the same issue, it seems they only work in the bathtub! Sadly that defeats the purpose of making cool elaborate designs, also if you fill up the bathtub they get submerged.- The product is sturdy and has a good look/quality. Sadly it's main flaw is that it doesn't stick to the bathroom walls."
"437","1","I was so excited to get new bath toys for my 15 month old. The boon gears are great. The pipes are awful, though. The suckers don't hold well to the wall. The pipes lean forward when they're full and they don't have anything in the pipe to regulate the  flow of water so it's almost impossible to set them up for the water to flow into each other (when they're full, the water comes out fast and forcefully. As they empty, the flow slows and the water stream moves by a few inches. They need something in between the reservoir and the holes to slow down the flow when it's full). In addition, one of the wheels broke the first time we used it. It won't spin anymore when water is poured over it.I am sorely disappointed with this purchase. I'm going to get rid of them and buy a decent toy."
"438","4","Pretty good. For those having suction issues, we found in the winter a cold tub with warm water will not suction well until the tub has warmed up. There is really nothing wrong at all with the suction cups. In fact, after a little while they become very difficult to remove. Only issue we had was one of the spinners was installed upside-down and wouldn't spin at all. It was easy to pop out and reinstall the correct way. The kids love them."
"439","4","This little set is perfect for toddlers who are active at bath time. My 19 month old always splashes a significant amount of water outside of the tub while having his bath. Sensory play is very important at this age so I don't want to restrict him from splashing around and enjoying the experience. That said, I am constantly wiping up the floors to prevent damage and potential slipping accidents. My son was immediately attracted to these colorful pipes, and spinning apparatus. This toy redirected his attention to splash around at the wall side of the tub, thus keeping the water INSIDE the tub! WIN! The product is made of good quality materials, and is sturdy when attached to the tub wall - will not slip off. Just give your little one a small plastic cup to scoop up the water and pour into the funnels, and they will enjoy a nice long bath with the independent play time every toddler needs. Your only job after showing them how this works is to sit next to the tub and enjoy a book or internet past time."
"440","2","They look awesome and it garnered some attention for a few months.  But they were super hard to clean - really hard - and even rinsing them well and airdrying after a bath and a few times soaking in bleach & water they still had a film inside which looked pretty slimy when wet.  There are many areas where one cannot reach with a brush (even a flexible bottle brush).  Some of the moving parts began to stick so I actually jus threw them away last week."
"441","5","Our 18 month old adores these. His older sisters (5 and 7) have been enjoying them in the tub too. They work great and stick really well. The only negative is that we have temper tantrums now because baby boy wants to take a bath all the time."
"442","5","Excellent product!  The spinning parts do a good job of slowing down water flow, so they're not just dumping water in to see it rush out the bottom, its actually slowly flowing through the parts.I brought this for my 3yr old daughter, she absolutely loves this.  Now everyday she looks forward to taking a bath so she can play with her toys.Even my 6yr old son loves them, he'll connect the pipes together forming this long line and have floating boats on the bottom to catch the water.I was so impress by this toy that I brought another set to give as Christmas present for my daughter's upcoming preschool Christmas toy exchange.  Definitely recommend!"
"443","5","These are so clever! I think they will be a new go-to gift idea for me for other people's kids, too! I got 2 sets, one for each of our boys. They are 5 and 2 1/2, and both of them just love playing with these in the bath! So I think the age range is pretty big on these. My favorites are the blue and clear pipes, with the little ""fan"" things that spin when you pour the water in! I love things like this, that are basic enough to build a child's creativity and imagination but that also teach basic principles of physics, etc. GREAT toys for boys and I would imagine girls, too, though I can't speak from experience with girls yet!"
"444","4","The kids love them for as much time as most other toys.  They stay put on tub walls but you need smooth glossy tiles or a tub surround to use on walls. We used them on the side of the tub.I wish they did more. Only 2 of the pieces have parts that spin, the other three have small holes that prevent the water from flowing too fast out of the funnel. The suction cups are not cheap and stick very well, you will likely be arranging them for your toddler.Parents will have just as much fun with them as toddlers.  Don't expect children under 3 to get much use out of them.A pitcher or large cup is a must have BTW."
"445","5","My 2 year old loves these pipes. It is his dream to connect these in one long pipe.  As it is his bathroom has a porcelain tile and these do not suction well to the walls. He has to section them to the side of the bathtub themselves. They still work, he just cannot put one on top of the other. He still plays with them every time he's in the bathtub and  they keep him preoccupied.  I love that he is understanding that the pressure of the water turns the wheels and the water squirts out at different angles as the water pressure goes down.  It really is a simple toy... but he loves it."
"446","5","I<U+2019>m always skeptical about toys. Not a fan of buying toys that just sit in a box. This one will definitely be used. Daily. My 4 and 1 ye old have been playing in the tub for quite a long time. I gave them each a tiny cup to scoop and dump water and they haven<U+2019>t had any arguments. My daughter keeps screaming in delight. Very cool. I<U+2019>ll probably add on with the cogs another holiday. Buy these!"
"447","5","I purchased this set on Prime Day and I am so glad I was able to get the lightning deal! Excellent toy that arrived in a nice package (if you need a gift) and works exactly as described. I wish I had bought it sooner. It keeps our kids (2 & 3) entertained while allowing us to expedite bathtime. We use them as an incentive to get in the tub. Highly recommend them. Note: colors of the pipes vary. The ones shown on Amazon and even on the box were different from what we received. Same colors, but different tube...i.e. The purple one shown here was clear for us; hope that makes sense!"
"448","4","Bath time is enjoyable with these little pipesPro:The suction cups suck well and stay on the wall.No Assembly and easy to useCons:Kind of limited selectionSome of the pipes leak, while this does not cause a mess, it is somewhat disappointingAlso you need a cup to move the water up to the funnel, while not a big deal, it is worth noting.I am not sure how long these will remain fun for her, but relatively unexpensive fun for the tub."
"449","5","Our toddler has always loved the bath, and these tub toys have raised his experience to the next level. He enjoys sticking and un-sticking the suction cups on the side of the tub, pouring water into the tubes, and watching the drips, jets and water mills. If we let him, he would carry them around the house all day, but we prefer they remain a special bathtub plaything. These toys stick securely to the sides of the bathtub and the glossy 4-inch tile of our tub surround.To establish a continuous flow of water and set up a chain reaction in which every tube is activated, you need a patient adult with a bucket and a steady hand or some other kind of reservoir not included with the set. Otherwise, as the water level drops, the jets of water coming out of the bifurcate and J-shaped tubes will change angles, first overshooting and then undershooting the next tube in the series. We used a 2000mL solution bag with attached tubing to get a steady flow. This is more for parental amusement than anything else, as the baby is just as happy to play with each tube one by one.These toys have held up to several weeks of normal toddler play, but it is easy to see how rough handling could damage the tabs that hold the water mills in place. They are lightly built in order to allow the water mills to spin freely. I clean these tubes with the baby's other tub toys in a vinegar soak once a week and let them dry between uses. We have had no problems with mold, residue, or other buildup.These tubes have been great fun for the price."
"450","3","I am having trouble getting the suction cups to remain stuck to the bath/shower wall.  I have an acrylic all in one bath/shower enclosure, so there shouldn't be any problems with this sticking.  However, before each nightly bath with my son I am having to restick 2-3 of these tubes.  Also, they come off while my son plays with them, and he is losing interest.  Could just be my set, but this is the problem I am having.  When they work they are fun."
"451","1","Do not buy this unless you have smooth glass tile. My tile has a matte finish, and these toys DO NOT STICK to my tile. I have other suction cup items (hangers for wash rags and shampoo) that stick to my tile, but these suction cups DO NOT WORK on my tile. They do stick to the porcelain glaze in the bath, but that doesn't allow enough space to chain them together. They made my baby cry with frustration."
"452","5","These are wonderful.  We've had them for over a year now and my 2.5 year old still loves them.  Some commented on the lack of water flow and that the water just trickles out, we have not found this to be the case and have been able to use all of the pipes together successfully.  They also stick to the walls great, as long as you get the suction cup wet first.  They stay on the shower walls for days at a time.  So glad we made this purchase."
"453","5","Bought these for my 3 yo and both he and my almost 5yo enjoyed them.  Made me wish I had gotten two sets.  They quickly figured out how to move and manage the pipes as some are ""twistable"" and you can make them face another direction.  They suctioned very well to our tile and the tub, but of course will NOT be able to stick where there are grout lines.  They are all semi transparent so they can see the water flowing through the pipes.  Will be getting another set."
"454","3","The concept behind these is great, and I was so excited to get them for my 3 and 5 year old for bathtime.  The pipes are a lot smaller than I was expecting, which is ok except that you can't really fit much water in them at one time, so the flow is constantly changing on them, making it hard to ""connect"" up and work together.  We got these with the Boon Coggs to go with them, and since the water pressure varies so much, it's very hard to put them together to work.  Overall a good concept, but we were not impressed with them."
"455","5","My tot's bath time has been made more enjoyable by these toy water pipes. We have endless fun arranging and rearranging them and pouring water through our creations.They dry easily with no added effort. We just rinse them and leave them attached to the tile on the wall. They have been in use for 3 weeks now and no sign of mildew yet. The suction cups work great on smooth surfaces.I have two sets. The pieces are the same but the colors vary.I would recommend these Boon water pipes for those looking for more interesting toys than just the floaty animals/rubber ducks."
"456","5","These are super fun little bath toys!  Although the company accidentally sent me a sippy cup at first, they quickly sent out the right order to replace it.  Now installed on my faux marble (i.e fiberglass) tub surround, they stick beautifully without falling off throughout the bath.  The little wheels turn as they should, and water squirts out in fun ways.  These are a great bath toy for any child from baby to toddler and older.  I'm impressed that the suction cup quality is good enough to keep them on through multiple baths (and even when they're sitting there untouched for days), but my 4 year old can still detach them with her fingernail and reposition them whenever she wants.  A definite recommendation for bath time!"
"457","5","My 3 y.o. and 1 y.o. love using these in the tub. Both are able to pour water into the tubes without any trouble.  The suction cups stick to both the tiles and the tub itself without any problems.  It works wonderfully for my 1 y.o. who loves to hold her hands under running water - she can do that without leaving the faucet on during bath time and wasting a ton of water."
"458","5","This is a fun little bath toy set for the little ones. It amazes me how much fun they have with it. I too get into it with them and we find ourselves smiling and laughing having a good time. It makes for a great gift for people you know with children. We gifted it to my wife's nephew and his parents even commented on how cool of a gift it was. Price and quality were up to par. 2 Shaka stars! Aloha."
"459","4","These toys are fun in the bathtub, but don't stick super well to our tile wall. The two pieces with spinning gears need to be totally full to spin the gears, and the three gear-free pieces drain slowly, so if you place a solid piece above a gear piece, it won't drain fast enough to make the gears spin. My toddler still has fun scooping water up into them, but you can't really build fun mazes with them which might make them less enjoyable as she gets 2+ and more creative with them. Not a bad purchase for young toddlers, but I doubt they'll be very interesting to her once she gets over the thrill of pouring water into them, and at that rate a regular old cup would have been just as satisfying."
"460","5","My daughter loves these tub toys.  She's obsessed with putting them under the running faucet so they'll spin really fast.  My one issue... the suction cups are very stiff and bent in the box, so it takes about ten minutes in the warm water for the suction cups to be pliable enough to stick to the side of the tub.  My kid likes to hold them and play with them, so it's not an issue, but when we first got them, I was trying to stick them to the tub to show her and they kept popping off, even before having to bear the weight of water.  So it kind of depends on your kid and how they use them."
"461","3","These have been an absolute favorite with our boys in the tub. They set up car washes and waterfalls. They have a blast.Only negative is there is some serious mold growing where the suction cup attaches to the plastic pipe. It doesn't affect its performance just grosses me out."
"462","4","We got this to replace some of our two year old toddler's old toys and she's a huge fan. She's into pouring things into other things right now so this is a quick, easy, and entertaining solution that keeps her loving bathtime and having lots of fun. Very easy to un-package and they stick on the bath tub wall well without falling off."
"463","5","I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of these pipes. The plastic is thicker and generally of a higher quality level than I expected. The edges have no hint of any sharpness, and the spinners spin freely and easily. My daughter enjoys pouring water through them or spinning them by blowing through them.These pipes are well designed too. The suction cups have a small finger-hold to them that allows you to break the suction off the wall easily. The drain ends of the pipes can also be rotated to affect how the pipes drain. This means you can orient the drain hole on some of the pipes to better control the directionality of the flow."
"464","5","These are the BEST bath toys!! My son now asks to take a bath every night and honestly I enjoy bath time more as well because i cant help but play a little too. I love that you can upgrade these by adding on the gears (which i plan on doing when he is older) to get more life from them. GREAT purchase and if youre thinking of getting them you wont regret it! The colors are true to the photo and look really modern and fresh in our white bathtub/shower. These are toys that dont need to get put away after each and every bath. Love them!"
"465","5","We absolutely love these pipe toys. And by we, I mean both our 3 and 9 years olds, and the adults! They suction easily and stay on tight. I've never had one fall off. The plastic and any pieces are sturdy, and the colors are bright! I've read a couple reviews on here that are negative about the pipes leaning when they're full or their kids getting bored because they don't stay full long enough. Well, we don't find these to be problems, we find them to be challenges! I feel that these add to the value of the toy because my children then have to use logical thinking to rearrange the pipes in order to best serve how they want to play at the time. And they do! It's fun to see them looking ahead to the next step, moving, testing, trying again, and proud when they figure it out! These are my new go-to gift to give kids!"
"466","4","These are great for use in the tub, my daughter enjoys them, but the blue and white one with the spinners inside do not work very well."
"467","5","These are way too cool.  I am not sure if my daughter them more than me. But I bought them to update some bath toys she had seemed to have grown bored with and I am very happy I did. Each pipe releases water different. The only issue is that they were so exciting she wanted to pull them off to hold.  Definitely purchase these if your kiddo loves bath play."
"468","5","At first I thought they were a bit small, and the water flowed through them pretty slowly. But they are perfect for my two and a half year old's little hands and he likes them.They all work like they are supposed to. Each component moves if it ought to, when water flows through it. I have to admit when I lined then all up so that they all move at the same time, each one catching the water of last it just felt good inside! It took several attempts, judging distance and how fast to pour water in the top and so you can imagine it's showing your kid a thing or two about science right?They haven't started to mold after several months of hanging around in our shower and bathroom and they stick great to our plastic tub/wall.Not bad at all."
"469","5","My 16-month old uses them to scoop up water in the bath. She hasn't quite figured out how to really use these yet but I think when she does, it will be a lot of fun. Also, I'm always wary of bath toys collecting mold but with these, I don't think that would be a problem. We just shake them off and put it away in our bath toys netting bag when we are done."
"470","5","These are great bath toy. Like all suction cups they stick well to smooth non-porous surfaces. We've used them on tile walls, tub walls, and the sides of a big plastic storage bin used as a toddler tub.I like that the end caps can be rotated which helps when arranging them to feed into each other. We use them with a plastic cup so it is easy to adjust flow through the different pipes. Our 2 yo likes seeing how the water trajectory changes with flow and different feeding structures.We move them out of the toddler tub (bin) to the shower wall or tub wall at the end of a bath so he can scoop out the water into the pipes. He's excited to play with them which helps bypass the ""no bath!"" tantrum at the beginning of bath time and also is more understanding that bath time is over because the water is gone."
"471","5","My son got these for Easter and months later he is still asking when it's bath time so that he can play with them.  He loves making different 'ideas' with the tubes and watching the water flow down.  He's 3 and can connect them to make a path for the water all by himself.  He does sometimes have trouble because the pipes don't always move in ways that make them easy to connect.  But they are a well-loved toy in this house."
"472","5","We buy a lot of things that frankly don't work out, but that is not the case with the bath pipes.  They are fun and they help me keep the bathwater on the wall side of the tub not the floor side.  Another reviewer was disappointed that the pipes don't connect or that the flow is not fast.  I am fine with the way they are, water flows from one pipe to the next, through the air to the next is part of the fun!  They are learning how water moves and different ways to configure the pipes.  The pipes empty slow enough for it to not be a chore keeping them filled.  Fast flow would be counterproductive.  They are pretty colors and a couple of them have water wheels inside.  The suction cups stick to the tile nicely, they don't retain water so no mildew or mold.  Both the 5 year old and 2 year old love them."
"473","5","Both of my kids, 5 and 2 love these.  Fun as individual toys even since our bath doesnt have a lot of wall space for the kids to use they have to stick them to the tub and they work just fine.  But really fun to connect them in the shower and see them work all together."
"474","5","My 3 year old son hates baths. But now when I say ""your bath is ready!"" Instead of whining and saying I don't wanna, he says YAYYYYYY BATH TIME!!!My one problem is that they don't stick to the kind of tile that's in my bathroom. They only stick to the tub, and that means they're right against the bath water. He doesn't care though."
"475","4","This is a great bath toy. My 2 year old loves playing with this in the bath. He pours water in each pipe to see what happens. My only comment is that the bent pipe with the turning piece (white one in this photo) doesn't work too well. I had no problems with it staying stuck on to our tile, it has not fallen off while he uses it."
"476","3","My son loves 3 out of the 5 <U+201C>pipes<U+201D>. 2 of them don<U+2019>t do much (1 trickles water out of the bottom of the pipe and one is supposed to have it shoot out the sides but is not designed well so it doesn<U+2019>t work). The suction cups to stick he pipes to the bathtub don<U+2019>t work very well either. We can only get 2 of them to stick for more than 2 minutes. The ones that do stick and work well are awesome. The whole set just needs a little bit better design to make it functional."
"477","5","This is a fun bath/sink/pool toy for little ones. My almost-2yo niece loved it. The suction is good but not so strong that a little one can't reposition the pieces. The pieces twist so you can position the spouts in different ways. It seems like a quality product that will hold up to hours of fun. I would definitely purchase this again for another kid."
"478","5","Bought these for my four year old. She loves playing in the tub and she's been playing with the same toys for a long time with nothing new, this definitly increased her interest in playing in the tub! They can stack them over one another or next to in any position they like and come up with multiple different 'designs' of how the water will flow. It's sort of like science in the tub. I'm so thankful I found these! They are made with sturdy plastic as well, and the suction cups stick very well to the tub or the wall."
"479","1","These don't stick well. Several had warped suction cups. Had to throw those away. They also don't stick to areas of a tub that has even a slight slant or curve, and are not easy to combine with the Cogs Water Gears as shown on the company's videos.I bought two sets for a gift for a family with children from age 2-6 and they quickly abandoned these for their old tub toys. Maybe I just got two bad sets but it was still a real disappointment."
"480","5","I bought these for my two year old as part of his Christmas present with some other bath items. He loves these! The suction cups work nicely to hold the pipes onto the side of the tub (but not the tile, for some reason) and he loves pouring water into them and watching things spin and water pour out in different ways. The colors are vibrant, they are well-made, and perfect for curious and playful toddlers."
"481","5","These are great fun for my toddler for bath time! Stay suctioned to tub wall well, don't fall off.  I think this product will grow with him as he can configure them differently as he gets bigger. Extra fun if you put the crayola bath color fizzies in the tubes and then pour water in :)Have become our go-to gift for Neices/nephews/friends kids- their parents rave about them as well!Updated: Still stay suctioned to bath wall and just as well several months (and daily use) later."
"482","5","After visiting our local children's museum where our toddler had to be torn away from the water works section, I was thrilled to find this set from Boon! This toy helped turn the tide of having bath time be a chore to now where our daughter doesn't want to leave the tub! The suction cups hold great against our standard smooth bath tile (or tub). The tubes are entertaining both individually or grouped together - and for parents too if your kid will let you join in the fun!"
"483","5","My 2.5 year old LOVES this.  He was not a fan of bath or shower time until this toy.  We had issues at first with the pipes sticking but then we realized that the power cleaner that we use to clean the shower caused a powder residue.  One we focused on making sure no powder remained, the tubes stuck well.  My son uses the Boon duck cups to pour the water into the pipes.  We also have the Boon from to hold the toys and have used it with our older kids as well.  After 5 years of use it still looks as good as new!  Love Boon."
"484","2","these are a cute bathtime idea, my child enjoyed them but for the price the suction cups are horrible! they dont suction good and constantly fall off the wall..wouldnt recommend these to anyone, i paid full price for these."
"485","4","My toddler has a last playing with these pipes in the bath. Each pipe has different size holes and the water comes out in various different ways. They are very colorful and fun. My only complaint is that they don<U+2019>t stick to my tub overnight. They have usually fallen down by bath time the next day. I<U+2019>ve just started taking them down when I clean up after baths. No big deal. These are definitely a good buy!"
"486","3","I was very excited to get these and I have to say my granddaughter does enjoy them.  BUT, her green one (which in her set is the one with the spiral in it - in the site picture it's the blue one) DOES NOT WORK.  I tried to see if the placement was just off but that is not the case.  I'm guessing it's just defective.  But the other 4 are good and she does enjoy them."
"487","4","For kids 2 and under they seem ok for entertainment.  They seem to run out of water really quickly so there isn't much for them to actually watch. Pretty much just a race to try and keep up. . Should have more water capacity or much smaller holes for letting the water flow.I took away 1 star for not really being that fun to watch.  Build quality was fine for kids.Overall I probably wouldn't purchase again."
"488","3","I was excited to get these for my grandson. But when he tried to play with them that night, the pipe they show as orange had the suction cup on the inside of the curve so it could not be put on the shower wall.  The other pipes were ""OK"", but the suction cups were not so good--they fell off the tile easily.  We do have smooth tile, so they should have stuck well.  I will probably be returning them and finding something else."
"489","5","This is an interesting bath toy. The suction cups aren't the best: our pieces usually end up on the bottom of the bath tub by next day but the toy itself keep my kids (from 2 to 9 year old) attention for a while every time they take a bath. Different pipes, different patterns, so many things to do with them unlike more conventional bath toys. I highly recommend this toy."
"490","2","Be very cautious buying these they do not stick to all surfaces. We have a slightly textured I guess plastic shower and they sometimes stick for a few seconds but that's about it. However I'm sure if you have a better surface for them to stick to then your child would love them but for us they were a big flop & a waste of money"
"491","5","My daughter loves these pipes. She constantly wants to go back to play with them. Colors are vibrant, made from a good material, and stick well to the tub. Each pipe will pour water out differently and we like to set up different courses for the same cup of water to drain into every pipe coming out of just 1 at the end. Good problem solving skills for little ones and let's their imagination roam. Only downfall is the suctions will sometimes fall off into the tub but overall a great product full of fun!"
"492","1","I just bought these a month ago, and I'm about to throw them away. They DO NOT STAY PUT!  We had another set similar to these I bought from Walmart, and they never fell down.  I spend half my toddlers bathtub time re-sticking them to the bathtub wall."
"493","5","Purchase these for use by the grand kids.  Each pipe has a suction cup on the side that allows them to stick to the tile on the tub wall.  The suction heads work well and are easy to remove from the wall once they are done being played with. Several of the pipes can be stacked so they flow from one pipe to another.  All five of my grand kids love these and I would definitely purchase them again."
"494","2","Love the idea, but it just doesn't work for us.  The suction cups are low quality and don't stick for long.  (Unlike the suction cups of several soap holders and a bath toy bag.) We ordered new suction cups, but these have a long neck and so that didn't work.  So right now it's a hand toy."
"495","5","My great granddaughter has just turned 2. I bought these for her Birthday,since she loves being in the tub. They were a tremendous hit, along with the Boon Water Clog gears.My great granddaughter  was suffering from allergies at the time she received her presents. These bath toys kept her happy and busy for over 30 minutes pouring water into the pipes from her cup.Easy to apply to the tub side or tile bath surround. Bright colors are also a hit with our baby girl and her mother.The toys were positioned with the Pipes above the Water Gears so the water poured through the Pipes turned the Gears for even more fun."
"496","3","My one and three year olds don<U+2019>t play with them much.The sound of these coming un suctioned and falling into the tub in the middle of the night is insanely loud and frightening."
"497","5","We love these water tubes.  My kids love playing with water and so they love dumping water down these tubes.  I like the variety and we experiment with how we set them up and if we can get the water to go from one tube to the next.  The suction on the suction cups isn't amazing and they fall down from day to day, but they stay up for our bath time and that's all that really matters to me.  I'd buy these as a gift for other water play lovers too."
"498","2","I have slightly rippled bathtub/ Shower walls and these suction cups do not stick at all. I have a few other suction cupped items in the shower that have no trouble sticking. The product is a good idea, unfortunately the design was a failure. They don't stay on the shower wall for more than 2 minutes MAX. Most fall off within 30 seconds. If you have anything but the smoothest surface to stick these to, don't bother."
"499","4","Well made. Very neat idea. For $13 I would have liked a couple more pieces. There is only so much you can do with only 5. Sturdy plastic and the suction cups suction well to my fiberglass tub. I only buy bath toys that can be easily washed and don't get water inside to mildew, and these fit the bill. Easy to wash every surface. Would buy again."
"500","5","After kiddo was loving the gears that Boon puts out, we got these on a whim and she loves playing with them.Btw, the colors of what pieces do what do not match the art on this set, but I don't think that matters. Same bright colors, just not the colors on the specific tubes"
"501","4","these things are awesome!!!! My green one is straight, and my orange one is the J.  The green one doesn't work the little spinner guy just doesn't have it in him to spin :( but nonetheless we have a ball. It is hard to get my little guy out of the tub.  He just turned two and has a ball with these. Make sure you get the gears!!! Makes for a better bath time ball!!! I swear if  I had these when I was little I would never complain about taking a bath"
"502","4","My boys like them but I had to return and get another set because one of them wouldn't stick to the wall of the shower and when the new box arrived there was one in it that wouldn't stick either.  They seem well made for the price but I think it may be the way they are packaged that bends the suction cup causing it not to get a proper seal."
"503","2","I'm sad to say, these are not that great. The angle of the downward pipe is not very useable, on all of the pipes. Mainly the orange and white pipes... You have to finagle your network of pipes around these two... I wish someone would have written this before..."
"504","4","These are a unique, fun bath toy.  They are fun to use in conjunction with the Boon water gears set.  My 4-year old really enjoys them, but can't set them up very well on his own (the suction cups are very strong, which is good - but means they take a fair bit of pressure to apply, and then are very hard for a little one to get off, or move around).  Also, I docked one star because the white piece doesn't spin at all - maybe if I fiddled with it enough, I could loosen up the paddle so it could spin freely like it's supposed to."
"505","5","My 3yr old is loving this set.  What a way to make bathtime fun and learn about fluid dynamics! The suction cups hold well - almost too well as I occasionally need to help him pop one off the wall to move it, but this means they also don't just fall off the walls either. Cleanup is a quick rinse at the end and the colors are a nice touch. They are a bit large when added with other bath toys so these are slowly pushing the others out as the favorite!"
"506","5","My 2 year old LOVE these water pipes. Each one funnels water differently. One of them you can even adjust the water flow. The suction cups are very strong, so they don't move around once you get your creation just right, & pour the water through."
"507","3","I got these for my six-year-old thinking you would really like them in the bathroom cuz he loves to build things. He enjoys them for the most part, but I wish that they fit together more so that he could build more. They will sit in each other if you want to build up and down, but you can't really go horizontal."
"508","5","I ordered these for my three year olds birthday and they are awesome.  Each pipe has its own opening for water to come out, and it is tons of fun in the tub.  I'm just now noticing that the color of my pipes are different for the shapes, but that doesn't bother me.  The colors are bright and the water flows out.  My son loves to be a ""scientist"" and stack the pipes so the water drains from one to another.  The suction cups hold well, and these double as great pretend trumpets too!"
"509","5","**Update 2 Years Later** My son is now 3 and he still LOVES this this toy.  They have spent  in the bathtub, get played with at almost every bath, and I havent had even one problem with them. I 100% recommend these!Have them in the tub for our 18 month old.  He loves playing with them and having momma pour water into all of these.I even enjoy setting one above the others above another and another and watching the chain reaction during his bathBoon always comes out with such great products!"
"510","5","lots of fun for the kids. suction cups have held up well, havent gone hard or cracked or anything. spinning parts do a good job of slowing down water flow, so theyre not just dumping water in to see it rush out the bottom, its actually slowly flowing through the parts."
"511","5","These are truly an awesome bath too! My daughter plays with them for so much time in her bath. She finds it soothing and comforting before bedtime as well. I find she really focuses on pouring the water and has fun seeing how the water comes out differently in each one of them. They stay suction to the wall very well as well."
"512","5","I bought my son these and a BUNCH of other Boon brand bath toys for Christmas and they are honestly amazing. They suction great but still come off when I need to take them off, the quality of the toys is high, and he has had so much fun with them. Most bath toys are so basic and expensive these days but I love Boon."
"513","5","I have three kids and have bought many bath toys through the years. Most of the time they have rarely played with them and just cluttered up the tub. These bath pipes are great and my 2 yr old request to take baths daily to play with these pipes. In fact he plays with them outside the tub as well. Good quality, good suction cup and good fun."
"514","5","Bought these for my 20-month-old granddaughter to play with in the bathtub.  She adores them!  Now she wants to play with them in the sink and anywhere there is water.  They are easy for her to handle and the different holes/spinners really keep her interest.  The only thing that seems to frustrate her about them is the suction cups -- they hold so well that her little hands cannot get them loose -- so she's been using them without attaching them to the side of the tub/sink.  Glad I bought these!"
"515","5","Huge hit with my two year old twin boys and 6 year old daughter. We need more so I ordered another set."
"516","5","I have a 17 month old son who loves bath time. With that being said I am always looking for a better toy for him. So far these have been the best one yet! He loves loves loves to pour water into the different pipes and watch it drain through. Two pipes have open bottoms with spinning exposed wheels inside so the water moves through fast but they get to watch the gear spin. The other three pipes have some what clogged bottoms so the water drains slowly but this is also quite fun to watch (apparently). The suction cups are strong, but with enough pulling they can be pulled right off with his little hands. Over all these have been a very good investment."
"517","4","My son loves these but the suction isn't great and they always come crashing down in the middle of the night so we have to remember to take them off after every bath. They are a fun toy for him but wish the suction was better."
"518","5","My kids love playing with these pipes! They suction to the wall in the shower/tub, and you can pour water in through the top to watch how it will come out the bottom. Each pipe has a different opening at the bottom, so the water exits differently out of each one. They also like putting them in different configurations so make the water travel through each one before coming out the last pipe. Very fun for them."
"519","5","Got these for my 1 year old who loves tubs, I wanted to get him something that he'd enjoy in the tub, as he really likes to put a cup up to the faucet while we're running his bath - these are perfect.He doesn't full get the concept of dumping water into the pipes just yet, I do it for him, and he loves watching the water run through them.Not too pricey, but well worth it for our family."
"520","2","Im not really crazy about these. They stick to the bathroom tile well. But I wish they were meant to be connected, because initially that<U+2019>s what my daughter tried to do when she played with them. The water also doesn<U+2019>t flow out of them, they have tiny holes in the bottom of most of the pipes; so the water either stays inside or streams out. It<U+2019>s also a pain to dry and clean."
"521","5","LOVE THESE!!!! I bought two sets because not much a child can do with just four pieces.Pros: Pretty colors.  FUN, educational toy for bath.Cons: Crisp plastic.  Expensive for what you get.I would love to buy again, but will not buy again because too expensive."
"522","5","My son wanted to take a bath right away when he saw these.  He cried when it was time to get out.  He had fun using them.  They didn't stick to the tile on the wall (wasn't 100% flat) but it did stick to the metal tub wall.  Once it is on you have to slide it up to get it off easily.  They stick very well to a flat surface."
"523","2","Cool idea and pretty fun except that the suction cups just don't stick well.  The parts fall down with just a little water inside.  Better quality materials for the suction cups would help soooo much."
"524","5","Five stars.  'nuf said.  But seriously, this toy can easily span from 10mo to 10years old.  I don't know if it will hold up for 10 years but it is doing a spectacular job for the past two months so far.  It grows from pouring water skills, to learning cause and effect, to manipulating water direction to erecting whole pipe configurations."
"525","4","A little smaller than we expected them to be. And they aren't made of the sturdiest of plastic. The suction cups on them need to be on a flat surface (like the side of the bathtub) to really get a good grip, but my autistic 4 year old LOVES them. The holes are a little small so one might run a little slow, and one might run a little too fast, but like I said my kid loves them so that's what matters to us. They made a good birthday present for him."
"526","5","This is a really cool, fun way to let your kid learn about cause & effect & they get to arrange them however they want to make the water fall in different ways.  Each one has a different feature, like a water wheel, two drain holes instead of one, etc."
"527","2","They did not suction to the tile or tub. A couple will stick and others will not for longer than 30 seconds. I tried putting them on the glass of the oven thinking it was my tub or tile but the same happened. As we play they start dropping like flies. I have other suction toys that work great.  If I hadn't thrown the boxes away I would have returned them. They are fun, I wish they would suction."
"528","5","Bought these for my 3 year old grandson. They are very well made and come in fun colors. He was immediately captivated by them and has so much fun with them. We bought the Boon Cog Water Wheels to go with them. I suggest buying them together. They can do more. It's fun for them to experiment with different ways to make the water flow and make the wheels spin. Highly recommend!"
"529","4","Such a fun toy that is great at developing hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills. The suction cups just don<U+2019>t last. My toddler and I both love these so much that I<U+2019>m going to use them to create a water table for outside play. I<U+2019>ll just have to super glue them, as opposed to using the suction cups."
"530","5","I decided to make a custom water table for my toddler with different toys and these stick really well to the sides of our Children's Factory water table and are easy to move around and adjust. They are colorful, but the colors seem to vary from what you see on the box. My toddler is partial to the pieces with the spinning wheels on them."
"531","5","I bought these for my 4 year old and he loves playing with these in the tub. This simple and clever toy has intrigued my son ever since he learned about water flow and management at the local children's museum. He sticks these on the tub, or shower wall and just keeps dumping water into one then tries to get it to flow into another to make a waterfall..from one to the other.  I recommend getting the<U+00A0>Crayola Color Bath Dropz 3.59 Ounce (60 Tablets)<U+00A0>for extra fun. He loves making the different colored water. Of course this really made bath time easier for all of us ! They are made well and overall worth the price. I could not find any negatives to note here.User X"
"532","5","I bought these for my 18 month son to play with in the bath tub.  He loves them, and now my 7 and 5 year olds want to bathe with him so they can use them also.  It is fun for everyone.  I find myself endlessly pouring water into them and watching the propellers spin around.  Fun for all ages."
"533","2","It's hit or miss if they stay attached to the tub. The white one has never actually had decent section-it failed to attach right from the start. The one the spins only spins if I make sure it's in positioned just right in the pipe. Still, when they work my kiddo is entertained by them."
"534","5","So they aren't perfect because you cannot line them up to drip into each other very well.  I don't care.  The toddler (three years old) loves them and they keep him occupied.  They dry easily.  Better than a lot of other bath toys out there which get all gunky and gross."
"535","3","I have had a hard time finding a good place to put these by the bath tub.  If I try them on the wall, I feel like they're letting water run down around/under the bathtub sealant, and if I put them on the wall of the bathtub itself, I have to leave the bath water super low.  My kids are 2 and 4 now, and I think the toys might be better when they get a little older.  They still have fun playing with them though!"
"536","5","Huge hit with my almost 3 and 5 year olds. They spent AN HOUR in the tub playing with these tubes while I cleaned the entire kitchen after hosting a party. Already worth every penny in my book. For the concerned parents, my kitchen is next to the tub so the kids weren't left unattended. Great teaching toy, well built, fun colors. Oh and the suction is legit."
"537","3","The suction on these is really poor and it requires a lot of tweaking to get the wheels to spin, etc.  We want to love these, but they aren't as easy to use as expected."
"538","5","These bath toys are really fun.  Because you can re position them so much they provide lots of different ways to enjoy them.  They stick well with the suction cups and are really entertaining.  I use them with a 2 year old and he thinks they are great fun.  He can't always plan out the best way to arriange them so they would be fun for older kids as well."
"539","4","These are cute, but certain ones usually fall off the wall after a few minutes of play. Overall, they provide entertainment for bathtime. My little one lost interest after only a few uses, but I'd recommend them to the right age group."
"540","4","We didn't need anything to keep the little one in the bathtub any longer, but I did want to see if these would be interesting to her and they were!They're well designed with clean edges and the ones with fans spin freely when water is fed into the top.Three of the pipes have caps that can turn - one simply swivels to control the direction of the spout, while one has 3 holes in it to allow more or less water to go through, and the last one has 3 holes on one side and a small U-shaped spout on the other (the T-shaped one).The suction cups hold quite firmly and luckily, there's a small tab on the back of each suction cup to facilitate easier removal from the tub/tile.It's possible to link/stack them together somewhat, but it really works best with the non-capped ones going into the mouth of the other ones.  For example the ones with no caps for me were the ones with the fan/turbine (orange and purple).  Trying to get the ones with caps on them to stay firmly within the openings of the other ones wasn't a good fit.They're fun and I hope that this leads her to have a curious and inquisitive mind about how and why these work as they do!"
"541","4","There really aren't a ton of bath toys out there I feel. At least none that my little girl liked. She loves these. They stick on the tub and can be moved around with a little effort. The only issue is if they are pulled off she tries to drink from them after a quick dunk. But they're easy, simple, and fun to play with. If you put these in a shower you could make some cool elaborate water flow systems from top to bottom"
"542","5","Sent these to my grand kids. Their mom sent me a text saying that usually she has to nag them to get them to take their baths, but that they started asking during dinner if they could take their baths as soon as dinner was done.  Win:WIn."
"543","4","My kids love playing with these in the bathtub every night. My only reason for 4 stars is that the suction cups are pretty weak. I can hear these crashing off at random times of the day despite getting them wet first before sticking them to the tub. They may stick better to tile than the tub insert we have. Overall a fun toy that stays up out of the way during baths."
"544","5","These are such a cute bath toy. My kids love them and they feel somewhat educational at the same time. It helps me redirect my youngest who otherwise would be dumping water on the floor---now she can dump water in these!"
"545","5","Fun, fun,fun for the grandkids!  They use and switch them up on the tub and wall for a great bath experience.  I may get more to allow for more complicated combinations of pieces.  Nice colors and well made, should last a long time."
"546","5","Such good design! These make bath time fun for ME and my 15 month old is totally entertained as well. The colors of the different shapes vary from piece to piece from the ones on the box. Like my straight piece is white, and (too lazy to go double check) but I believe my tshape is blue.These are fun! And the older baby gets the more fun he'll get out of them. They seem high quality! I bought an extra set for my nephew who's about 18 months."
"547","5","These bath pipes are awesome! Suction cups are super strong and don't fall off until you pluck them off! Plastic is nice and thick. Bottom half of pipes can be rotated so that water shoots in different directions. Fun bright colors and my 1.5 year old loves taking a cup and pouring water in them and watching the flippers spin or water shoot out at him. I'd buy this as a gift for all the babies I know- unique, great quality, and fun!"
"548","2","Package arrived torn yet outer box intact so stars for that. Have yet to give it fir Christmas gift with its torn box which looks bad!"
"549","5","Kids have a blast with these, but when the suction dries out it pops off the wall and clatters into the tub quite loudly.  Best to take off the wall after bath or be prepared to constantly wonder 'what just fell?' in the middle of the night."
"550","5","Briliant! Its such a unique set. You cant go wrong purchasing this for your little one or as a gift. My little one's fav are the ones in green and white. They have a small fan kind of design that swirls. The suction function didnt work for us since we try it on the tiles (we dont have a bath tub, rather a square shower)."
"551","2","I was disappointed with this item. The bath essentially has to be empty to have any room to connect these pieces. Out of all the bath toys I've bought, the kids lost interest with these the quickest. I somehow thought we could sort of connect them together to drip into each other, even with the bath almost empty, that doesn't work. Plus, the water drips out wherever there is a spinney wheel."
"552","5","This is a huge bathtime hit with the kid. Initially he would only play with putting water in the top of one, but now he'll position one tube over another to cause a chain reaction activating both. They don't hold water and get moldy. They are great!"
"553","5","Our 10 month old received these for Christmas. He likes playing with them even though he doesn't really get how they are supposed to work yet. Our other son, who is almost 5, LOVES them. The suction cups don't work that great for us (this is a common problem for us, so I think it is not necessarily a problem with the pipes), but they are fun anyway."
"554","5","I bought these with the<U+00A0>Boon Cogs Water Gears<U+00A0>for my 2 and 5 year olds.  The pipes are great, and the kids love to play with them.  A thing to note: the suction cups don't stick well to tile, but my kids just stick them to the walls of the tub.  Sadly, the cogs are not a good addition to these (I left a review over there too). So my advice would be to get the Boon Pipes but skip the Boon Cogs."
"555","5","My boys LOVVVVE THESE! I do not allow the usual bath toys in my house that squirt water or cannot be cleaned easily so these were a great solution! They stay suctioned to the walls and are easy to remove. Easy to clean too! Not sure if it<U+2019>s recommended but I put mine in the Dishwasher."
"556","3","It was ok. The kids enjoyed it for a bath or two. The quality was good but it doesn't have an open bottom to make a trickle down effect so it didn't want have a lot of pressure to turn the wheels and it overflows out the top. Not what I was looking for."
"557","5","So I have a toddler who lives to play with water. That means I live for ways to keep that water in the bathtub. These are awesome. He loves playing with them, they drain so even when he yanks them off the wall to hang them over the tub water spillage is limited. He also loves turning the bathroom faucet on and watching how these work. Basically a decent priced awesome bathtub toy."
"558","2","Of the five pipes, the two with the spinners are fun and the other three are really lame. They are just stoppers with little holes in them. I can think of a lot of ways the could have made them more fun."
"559","4","My daughter loves these. They stick to the wall great and work fantastic. She has so much fun making different pipe trails to pour water in. Only reason I took away a star is because the blue one had a little crack upon delivery and leaks through the front. Would definitely still recommend these though!"
"560","4","I think this is okay for very young children (2 or 3).  I thought the pieces would all connect together and would be more interchangeable and we could make a really neat designs.  I think there are only two or three different configurations between two or three pieces."
"561","5","These bath tub toys are great! The suction quality is nice and the plastic is very durable.My two year old and 8 month old love playing with them. They would also be great for older children to position and orchestrate a fun water trail. I totally recommend them."
"562","4","Got this for my toddler for Christmas, but even my older kids enjoy playing with them in the bath. We've never been able to get the green one to stick to the tub or wall, but the other ones work great."
"563","4","These are great and would be even better if we didn't have matte tile :-( they won't stick to it. They'll stick to the bathtub at least but our bath tub is from the 70's, so it's short and not a lot of room once the water is in."
"564","3","Not very easy to set up for a three year old to have the water flow from one pipe to the next. They can only do it on the tub as opposed to the shower wall. They don<U+2019>t stick very well, for some reason, on the shower wall and I don<U+2019>t want the kiddos to stand in the tub while playing with them. Alas, they still <U+201C>play<U+201D> with them."
"565","2","Two of the five don't spin properly and none of them actually suction to anything very well. Even in a glass shower the cheap suction cups they use don't hold. We love most of the other Boon products we've purchased, but this didn't even come close to being worth anything. Save your money and find a different bath toy for your kid."
"566","5","These came today in the mail so I can't speak on long term. My twin girls love them! We used them with the Boon spinning gears! Half way thru their tub I put some color tablets in the bath to keep them happy a bit longer. Today I put a tab in each of the tubes that has a stopper. It was great! Instant color and lots of giggles! Even after the color dissolved they continued to play with the tubes. They stick very well even with lots of pulling on them by 2 yr olds. Great product!Pros:Easy to configure and the suction cups work wellSturdy plastic semi clear color with pieces that can be moved to direct flow easily.Works well with boon gearsEnough pieces for 2 children to play nicelyCons:They came in different colors then showed in the photo but I don't but some people may"
"567","1","I regret this purchase every day. I was so excited to give this to my toddler. It wont stick in any of our showers and was missing the clear one."
"568","5","My 3 year old loves to pour water into the different pipes to see what each one does. His favorites are the ones with the gears that spin when water is being poured into them. Great bath time toy to get little minds working!"
"569","5","These are a really cool bath toy, and I usually give them as gifts too. The kids play for hours with these, they engineer various designs. I did notice that soap residue builds up in these, but I'm going to try putting them in the dishwasher to get them looking like new again."
"570","5","1, 2, and 3.5 yr olds in a bath together. Enough to share, all enjoy- though some are clearly the favorites. you will want a cup or something though for them to pour water from. Nice addition to bath toy collection, and since they stick to the wall, I don't have to clean them up when it's my turn for a bath<U+0001F609>"
"571","5","Biggest water toy hit in the family.  Originally purchased for my one year old,  my two and four year olds love playing with them too!  The suction cups are durable and stick and restick well and they're made very nicely."
"572","3","They seemed well made tho they sadly wouldn't stick to a vintage bathtub I guess I'm not that surprised! I just didn't think about it when I got them! they stick to a normal bathtub fine tho!"
"573","4","These are great. I knocked one star off because one of the tubes has a spinner that doesn't really spin. They stick well to our shower and are fun for both a 2 year old and us oldies to play with. I think a review commented that the tubes were not see through, ours are partially see through and partially not."
"574","5","Kids really live these things. Wet the wall, wet the toy and stick up...they stay up through the kids playing. Really glad I purchased these be a use they've added some fun to bath time. They enjoy watching the pipes spin and the water flow."
"575","4","My toddler loves these. We got these because he was throwing tantrums around bathtime. After a day or two of playing with these, he now looks forward to bathtime. The only issue is that the ""T"" shaped one has a leak, so it doesn't work well."
"576","5","My 7 month old has been enjoying these for 2 months so far. And so have his parents! They allow for a lot of flexibility and creativity in how you arrange them. They'll only be more fun once he's old enough to pour the water himself!"
"577","3","Though I enjoy the product itself, this is not meant for bathrooms with poor ventilation. Our bathroom tends to the humid side and as a result all of the parts inside and behind the toy became intensely covered in mildew. A wonderful product in most regards. My child loved them. Just not for everyone sadly."
"578","3","I love the look of these and was excited for them to arrive to use with my kids during bathtime. However, they are difficult to position to get the water to flow from one to the other. I could see them as being more fun for kids who are a little older (5+) and who are quite patient, but for my toddlers they have been kind of a bust."
"579","4","My son really likes these and plays with them constantly in the tub. Great for little ones but me being a perfectionist I can only give it 4 stars because the water in the green tube can get stuck and not pour completely. But for the price it's a great toy for the tub."
"580","2","I debated a long time whether or not to get these, but my kid loves the bath so much I figured he'd love these. They're a great concept but the suction cups work not at all. We have a one piece plastic bath insert thing that is very very very slightly textured and they suction for 2-3 seconds and that's it. Might return it."
"581","5","15 mo loves these and so does our 5yo! Lots of bath time fun for everyone. Lots of fun arranging different setups. You just need a little cup to pour the water into the pipes. Seem well made. I will update 6 months to a year from now.Update 12/22/16: One of the best bath toys we have ever owned. I have a blast helping dd set it up and play."
"582","4","These are neat. I got them for my almost 2 year old. She likes when I pour the water in but she just wants to rip them off the wall. The suction cups are really good...so she can<U+2019>t get them off and then she gets mad. Maybe she will enjoy them more when she<U+2019>s a bit older."
"583","5","kids loved it when I surprised them when I got them to the shower, they didnt want to come out and my 3 yr old was crying to get back in the tub, usually I have to drag him in the shower, now I had to drag him out of there :)They stick to the tiles of the bathroom nicely, and none fell out so far, hopefully they stay like that.Happy with the purchase"
"584","3","The two that have water wheels are fun but the other ones are kind of meh. We got the gear set too and they are worse than these. You can<U+2019>t get the gears to spin with pouring water on them. You have to turn them with your hands. Again, great concept but the just don<U+2019>t work that well."
"585","5","Got these for my grandson who just turned 2 before Christmas. On Christmas day, he actually carried them around with him and cried if anyone else touched them. Lol. Now they're in the tub and all the littles LOVE them."
"586","5","These are really fun and a good way for kids to be creative! My 6 year old daughter loves setting them all up in different ways and letting her little brother pour the water in. A unique and fun bath toy...easy to clean too!"
"587","4","These are a lot of fun for water play. Some of them don't work or spin like they should, but still provide fun for the kids, although a little frustrating for them."
"588","5","I got boon toys after hearing from another mother how they work so well. I have a 2.5 year old son who didn't like taking showers before. Now he actually asks me for showers just to play with these. I thought it would be only a few nights. Here we are 3 weeks out and he still loves these things!"
"589","3","I purchased two packs of these as a part of a lightning deal. Our kids love playing with them in the bath, but one tube out of two packages was defective and would not stick to the tub.  Aside from that, the toy had a fun factor of about one week. After which it was never touched again."
"590","2","We have had these for a few weeks- by week one the plastic suction cups were all discolored with mildew- I can clean them, but it<U+2019>s clear the suction cups are not mildew resistant. For a bath toy I would expect mildew resistance. It<U+2019>s too bad- it<U+2019>s a great bath toy functionally - some better quality suction cups would have made this an awesome toy."
"591","2","Never sticks and stays on tub walls. Kept falling and freaked out my toddler."
"592","1","This product is terrible. They don't even stick to the walls or glass doors, even after cleaning everything. I thought my daughter would love them but since they don't stick to the walls well, she can't even play with them. Very disappointing."
"593","3","theyre ok, bought along with the boon cogs for bath fun. these suctions dont last past one bath. that isnt a huge problem but hearing them all fall in the middle of the night gets annoying, then theyre just something else to pick up. that being said, they are cute and fun if you place them well."
"594","5","I have two kids - 2yo and 11mo (boy and girl).  They both are fascinated by this set of pipes.  They pour water through them and rearrange them for 5-10 minutes each bath.  We've had them for around 4 months and they're still holding up perfectly, suction works great, and they don't collect anything dirty.  Recommend!"
"595","5","My 3.5 and 1.5 year old children love these bath toys. We also have Boone Cogs in the tub and they like to use them together. They clean up easily and don<U+2019>t get nasty. I will be buying more for gifts."
"596","5","My son would play with these all day if I let him.  I thought he would get bored quickly like he does with all of his other bath toys, but that wasn't the case.  He loves to move them around and create different paths for the water to flow.  The suction cups on these work great!"
"597","5","This is a really neat toy!  My 2.5 year old loves it.  Stuck to the walls very easily, and he said ""that's awesome!"" about it no less than 15 times during his bath.  The only one that didn't work very well is the straight tube with the small wheel in it shaped like a corkscrew - that didn't turn, but it's a minor complaint and may just need a little bit of fiddling to get to work.  Very happy with this buy!"
"598","5","Our toddler loves these and hasn't gotten tired of them since we bought them 6 months ago.  They don't always work together very well (i.e., water doesn't flow from one to the other perfectly), but that doesn't matter to her.  Great for fine motor development and learning to pour water carefully."
"599","3","Bought for my toddlers a year ago and they still haven't interacted with them much, they don't get the idea to set them up and pour water into them, for some reason it's just not intriguing . They are good quality though"
"600","3","I'm not sure what I was expecting, but definitely more than what these little pipes put out. Not all that impressive and my 2 year old hasn't seem interested in playing with them after a couple uses. I've tried arranging them to work together as a little waterfall contraption and it is difficult to get the water stream at exactly the right pressure for them to flow fluidly through each pipe. Kinda a dud product."
"601","5","My 16 month son loves these toy and always request to play with them. I would just make sure you do you best to flip them over to dry them out, just to avoid the possibility of mold."
"602","5","I bought these for my 3 year old niece and my 6 month old nephew for bath time. They love to use these in various ways and the suction is awesome. I will probably look for the rest of the series to buy for bath time!"
"603","4","I thought they connected together some way.  I don't see how they do.  My 4 year old was excited when they arrived but not that impressed in the bathtub."
"604","5","My son loves these. We arrange them in different ways to make the water flow from one to the other and he has a blast. They are the perfect size for our bathtub and the perfect size for him, he is two. I got them for his birthday and he has used them every night since. It also keeps him from throwing water outside of the tub because now he has somewhere to aim it."
"605","4","These are pretty fun little bath toys that can be played with at many ages in many ways! They stick on the bath wall well and hold up to having water poured in them. They have small holes so that the water doesn't rush out of them too quickly."
"606","5","These make an excellent bath toy.  My 4 year old loves these.  She enjoys arranging them and rearranging them to work individually or all together.  A younger kid would probably enjoy them as well, but 4 feels like the right age to me.  Enough dexterity to attach and detach each water pipe to the wall independently, and lots of thought going into their arrangement."
"607","5","These work GREAT together with the Boon cog gears for bathtub. My daughter spends a ton of time engineering water paths and obstacles. Very entertaining for the kid who like water in motion."
"608","5","Like these.  Didn<U+2019>t work well in our spa tub (which doesn<U+2019>t have shower wall) because there isn<U+2019>t much vertical height above the water to set up all the tubes for the water to flow down through.  But that<U+2019>s not not product<U+2019>s fault.  Works really well in shower, and although it probably makes the shower longer than necessary, it<U+2019>s a good way to convince our children to take a shower rather than a bath :)"
"609","4","The boy loves it.  The problem is that he used to also love just bathing in general.  Now he doesn't want to get his hair wet.  Just wants to play with the toys.  Finally got him to willingly lather up yesterday after one week of protest."
"610","4","I think these are cool. I set them up for my 1 year old to see while he bathes. He'sKinda like meh but I have fun. They stick well if you wet the suction cup first. But my kid can still pull them off easily. He plays with them in the water by holding them up in the air or over his head."
"611","5","Got these for my 3.5 year old son & he loves them. I had to force him out of the bathtub because he didn't want to stop playing. These are a great toy to substitute all the 'baby bath toys' he had but had outgrown."
"612","2","meh...overall, these pipes were pretty bad. other than the one that has the spinning wheel......well the one with the spinning wheel that actually spins. wish i would have bought this at the store because it would've been returned. at the time i didn't know i could return with Amazon."
"613","5","We purchased these for our toddler and she couldn<U+2019>t be happier. They pair with the set of gears for added fun. Truth is, I like them just as much as she does. They make the random shower beer an interactive science project. My wife seems to like them as well, as I hear the detachable shower head being aimed at what I can assume is one of the tubes. It must be relaxing because she<U+2019>s always happier after her shower."
"614","5","My 3-year old and my 1 year old love them in the shower. The only thing is that they seem to fall a lot. Other than that, this is a great product!"
"615","5","My son loves pouring water in the bath (and making a huge mess!). These let him do what he loves but keeps him pouring it in the tub. He's 4 and spent at least 30 minutes playing with these in the bath last night. There are little tabs on the suction cups to help pull them off, but still a little difficult for him. They stuck well to our tub."
"616","5","Kids are 6 & 4 and still love using these tunes to engineer in the tub. Add in a couple plastic cups and they are set! Definitely adding these to my list for birthday gifts - unique & so much fun"
"617","3","There<U+2019>s a couple pieces that don<U+2019>t make sense in the fact that they won<U+2019>t stick to the wall or be useful in the position they<U+2019>re supposed to be in, but the ones that do work are really cool!!"
"618","5","These were a total life saver! I love Boon, but this is probably my favorite product from them. The pipes provide much needed bathing entertainment for my toddler, they suction to the tub very well and even have these nifty little tabs you can press to release the cup because they sick so well!"
"619","3","I loved the concept, but they don<U+2019>t work so great. The suction on some is not good and they keep falling. Also, the white pipe is the only one that has a nice strong stream; the others mostly trickle water out. If these two things are corrected, these would be awesome."
"620","2","water doesnt flow very nicely in the ones with holes. I also thought you could put these together and have the water flow from one into the other but it doesnt really work well eg from the one with holes to the other with spinner - there is not enough pressure/water when it flows through the hole to the other tube to make the spinner spin. so they are just individual tubes - not to be used together"
"621","3","Some of the spinners wouldn't soon as we poured water through them. My daughter just wanted to pull them off and play with them. Wasn't interested in pouring water through them. There was only one that I thought was cool enough to pour water through and that was the white one with the 6 prong wheel inside, the rest were really rather boring. My daughter thought so too."
"622","5","Toddler loves these! Easy to put on the walls. He doesn't even pour water through them, he just sticks them on the walls of the bathtub over and over. Good quality, and fun for him to play with. The suction cups are really the thing you want to have work on these, and they do! Highly recommend."
"623","5","These pipes were a great addition to our bathtub toy collection, our son loves that he can build different configurations and have them pour into each other.  The suction cups are very strong so they stay in place and the ends can be rotated to adjust the flow. A great way to keep your little one entertained during their soak in the tub!"
"624","5","Very fun and work as expected.  I thought you could connect them but it really doesn't work that way.  Still He loves playing with them."
"625","2","They don't stick to the wall well. They come off when water is running through. They also fall off randomly in the middle of the night making creepy noises in the bathroom. We played with them a couple of times but gave up and no longer use them."
"626","5","This is a fun toy for toddlers who love to play in the bathtub!  I had bought our 1 year old grandchild this a year ago and bought one for another grandchild this Christmas!"
"627","3","I was so excited about these but in practice they're just not as fun as I thought they'd be. They're kind of hard for my son (4 yrs) to figure out and even I was not impressed by them."
"628","5","These are of excellent quality. I got them to keep at my home for when my grandchildren come to visit. My 5 year old granddaughter was the first to play with them and they kept her entertained for quite some time. I can't wait to for my other grandchildren to try them out too. Definitely worth the money."
"629","2","I wanted my girls to love these because I thought they looked so neat! But both my 3 year old and 5 year old used these for a couple of baths and then ignored them and went back to using the random assortment of plastic cups that they played with prior to the arrival of Boon Pipes."
"630","3","I would give these 5 stars if they stuck to our plastic tub surround, but alas, no matter what technique I try, they do not stay up longer than a split second. I have tried everything - lots of wet attempts, dry attempts, even double-sided tape. My 2 yo twins LOVE playing with these and would I'm sure love them even more if they were attached to the wall - I am almost about to glue them up, but was very disappointed that the suction did not work."
"631","4","I bought these to entertain my 2 year old in the tub and they ended up also entertaining my 6, 7 and 10 year olds in the shower too lol. Lots of fun and clean up easily when soaked in hot vinegar water."
"632","3","The suction cups don't stay put on some of them. They come out of the toy AND don't stick to wall well even with a little moisture."
"633","5","My 4 month old baby is entranced by these. Some of them are cooler than others (pink and orange pipes are kind of lame compared to the rest) but overall they're a super fun addition to bath time, and I think they're also helping my baby start to figure out some basic ideas about water and how it interacts with objects. Would recommend to anyone, especially with a baby between 4-12 months."
"634","5","I bought these for my 2 year old son who loves to dump and play with water... now all my kids play with these pipes while in the tub, including my 8 and 6 year old! Great simple toy and seems to be made well."
"635","5","She loves them. Sticks well on the tile."
"636","5","These are great!  I have two grand kids, 3 & 5, and they are great for both of them.  They are made of very durable plastic, the suction cups work great and there are endless combinations.  The only thing you need is a cup to fill them with water."
"637","4","These are super cute. 4 yr old loves using them. Only complaint is you have to line them up just right to get them all working as they should. But he loves making different designs and seeing how the water moves through them. The older kiddos love pretending they're mad scientists with them."
"638","5","Packing was great. Box was not damaged at all! And the product it self it sturdy and beautiful! Looks like it can take many hits from a toddler lol BPA free!"
"639","2","Although my daughter loves this toy, it does not stick to certain surfaces. This does not stick in our shower. She just pours water in them while holding them."
"640","5","I absolutely love these water pipes! I bought these for my daughter who has just turned 2 and she plays with them constantly! She doesn't have the strength yet to pull them off the wall so I need to help her out with that, but other than that these are great! All of the tubes rotate to change direction so it can be endless fun and endless possibilities of positioning the pipes."
"641","5","My three year old loves these! He loves to stick them on the side of the bath in various arrangements and watch the water flow from one to another. Also a great distraction when I'm trying to wash his hair.They are pretty sturdy and easy to clean. I would recommend them to a friend."
"642","3","My 2yo thought these were fun for about a month. Will have to put them away for a while. He can't pull them off the tub or the tile, so he was a little discourages by that...and one of them the suction cup doesn't stick at all. He uses that one to pour water into the others. Other than that they are very sturdy and well made."
"643","5","Simple fun toy for bath time.  Maybe even a little educational (the physics of hydraulics). The boys play with it all the time in the bath."
"644","4","My 5 year old son LOVES these pipes! The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they are a little more difficult than expected to make the water flow into the next one. I am not sure if it has to do with the mouth opening of them or how far they stick off of the wall. He's not frustrated by it but my 2 year old son was."
"645","2","The suction is great but the water goes through really fast so the ""waterfall"" doesn't last long at all. One of the spinners did not turn even with a little push. Also can't line them all up because 2 of them turn to the side."
"646","5","Absolutely adorable. I bought these for my toddler who was suddenly afraid of the shower. I combines it with the Ace My Own Shower and some Crayola Bath Crayons, and now I can't get her out of there.Rinse Ace 3801 My Own Shower Children's Showerhead with 3-Foot Quick-Connect/Detachable Hose and Blowfish Character"
"647","5","Bought this for my nephew for Xmas. He loves playing with them and they are good quality. Still holding up and he can be a bit fought with toys."
"648","5","I have a 3 year old son who never wants to take a bath. Sound familiar? This product is so creative yet simple. My son, who loves to build things, fell in love immediately. It is hard to pull him out of the tub. They can be arranged in any order on the wall, then you just poor water and watch the magic happen.The suction cups work well, however, you may want to make sure that your wall is fairly flat. If not, the suction may be compromised. The design is so simple, that I expect the product to last a very long time. Well done."
"649","5","Very colorful and durable. My 8 year old son loves them. Glad to see you can still buy quality toys. So many cheap crappy ones out there. These will last through the years for sure. Would be fun to buy an additional pack."
"650","5","My 4 year old loves these.  He likes to figure out different ways to build his waterfalls with them.  They stick to the walls well & clean up nice in the dishwasher too."
"651","5","Highly recommend for anyone needing to get their kids in the tub more.  Lots of fun and durable.  It teaches them about physics and engineering as well.  Great job!"
"652","1","I bought these for my kindergarten agars daughter. I also bought the gears and the jellies. I hoped that my daughter would enjoy setting up different configurations and have fun while learning and problem solving  in the bathtub. The water barely makes the gears turn and the tubes work very poorly. I am very disappointed and wish I would have made a different choice. Do not buy these!"
"653","4","The quality of the toy itself! It looks fun and interactive for my daughter! I was diasappointed that the packaging on the inside was damaged. Other than that great!"
"654","5","My kids love baths. I'm always trying to find unique toys for them to enjoy during bath time. My 3 year olds love pouring water on cups on the ledge of the bath, which can get pretty messy. These fix that problem because the water poured into the tubes drains into the tub. Each tube has a unique design and feature to it. Even my 9 year old enjoys these tubes!"
"655","3","They are fun but I'm not all that impressed. The water doesn't come out very fast in the ones that don't have spinners."
"656","3","Solidly constructed but not all the pieces work really well with water. Not as exciting or as configurable as I thought they would be. Cool colors though."
"657","5","Our toddler really loves playing with these along with the cordinating gears. The suction in them is excellent!"
"658","4","Fun concept,  but the suction cups aren't as strong as I would like and keep falling down in the tub, especially the white one that splits the water into two directions. Still fun enough for my toddler to enjoy bath time."
"659","2","For the price these did not perform as described in the description. The water didn't seem to shoot out in such a way that the toys could fill each other in sequence and they would fall off the wall in the middle of the night and freak me out."
"660","3","These, in theory, are great. I like how they can be used but they do not stick that well to my tile bath tub walls and fall off a lot."
"661","5","My kiddos love playing with these tubes. We purchased them for our youngest who recently turned one, and though she's not playing with them how intended, the bright colors and ability to hold water has her intrigued. My toddler on the other hand loves to move around and try different arrangements. Definitely a hit."
"662","5","These are so much fun.  My 4 and 6 year old have such a great time playing with them.  The suction cups hold well and everything seems to be built strong.  We have had these for over 7 months and my kids play with them every night during bath time."
"663","5","These have been extremely entertaining for well over a month now, and the suction cups are much stronger than I would have expected. Pleasently surprised!"
"664","4","Quality pieces that stick well but it<U+2019>s hard to get them set up to flow into each other. My daughter loves them in the tub otherwise!"
"665","4","Great bath time toy. My older son enjoys it more since it's harder for my younger son to pour water into the small opening."
"666","5","My son (and I admittedly) have a blast moving these around in various configurations and watching the water flow through.  The angle of some of the pipes can be changed to redirect flow while others have end caps that can be rotated to limit or turn flow off altogether. Would definitely recommend.  Might even get a second set for more elaborate setups."
"667","3","Very fun but does not stick to wall well.  These pipes will stick to wall for a little while but then will fall off after about 30 minutes. If just looking for an item to stick to the wall for 20 minutes or less then these work great."
"668","5","They are a little small but otherwise a home run! My kids love them! Suction cups work great. Very fun!"
"669","5","PROS:<U+2022> lots of fun to see the water flow through the various pipes (especially the wheels that spin)<U+2022> modular, can be rearranged in different ways<U+2022> water flows slowly, so you can really see what happens in each pipe<U+2022> can ""connect"" pipes by placing them above one another for continuous water flow<U+2022> pipe bottoms swivel/turn for even more possibilities to ""connect"" and rearrange<U+2022> suctions well to fiberglass tub wallCONS:<U+2022> a little hard to get off for a child <U+2014> though I think it's a lot better to have these be on the stronger suction side than having them constantly pop off, it just means that a little helping hand is needed so the child can play and rearrange these themselvesThese water pipes are a lot of fun <U+2014> my 3-year-old likes endlessly pouring water into various containers, so these have been a great hit! I love that these are modular and you can arrange them into all kinds of contraptions <U+2014> it's especially neat that the bottom of each pipe swivels, so you can place them at various angles. It is also interesting to see how the water flow is impacted by how quickly and how much water you fill in. The top area of each pipe has a narrow hole in the bottom (right before the ""fun"" part of each pipe), which slows down the water flow, so you can really see what the water does in each pipe. The one exception is the green, angled pipe <U+2014> much of the bottom isn't see-through. Overall, a really neat set with lots of possibilities for play. Wholeheartedly recommend!"
"670","5","This provides so much for the children when they are in the bath tub.  All children love pouring water so this fits the bill.They are loving it so far and can't wait to take a bath again."
"671","4","These are really fun bath toys. I enjoy setting up little pathways for the water to flow down these just as much as my son does! They stick pretty good but that part could be better as they fall off occasionally while playing."
"672","4","This is a pretty great idea and a clever way to keep a young child occupied in the tub. Unfortunately the suction cups don't adhere as well as I'd like to our old bathtub and our (newer) wall tile, limiting the configuration options."
"673","3","This is such a neat idea. Something for them to play with. The suction cups don<U+2019>t hold very well though and it takes a lot of water going in for them to do all of the cool little features. I probably wouldn<U+2019>t buy again. The quality is good however, just the suction cups don<U+2019>t work well."
"674","5","This toy is awesome.  My 15 moth old loves these things.  She doesn't quite understand all the cool things you can do with them yet, but they are captivating none the less.  I brought a couple along with us to the pool the other day and the older kids (3-5?) all wanted to play with them and try out different sequences and distances for pouring water into them."
"675","5","My entire family loves these! Bath time has become much more fun. We also purchased to Boon bath gears and together they make a great set."
"676","4","Fun bath toy. Suction cups are mediocre at best, which hampers overall enjoyment, but overall it's a great idea."
"677","5","Very cool toy.  Great suction. Both my 5 year old & 18 month toddler like these.  Only downside is they encourage kids standing in tub.  I would recommend for 2-5 year kids."
"678","4","Concept is interesting but my child wasn<U+2019>t interested in it. Probably for younger kids 1-2 yrs old"
"679","5","I bought these for my son for Christmas, thinking he might still be a bit young for him (he's 15 months), but he loves his bath so I gambled. He ADORES them. He loves seeing how they work together and on their own, and is even happy to sit and spin the little wheel by hand for his own amusement. I love that these aren't toys that splash because let's face it, we have plenty of that, but they still entertain him endlessly. Highly recommend!"
"680","5","These, along with the Boon Cogs and Moluk Rain Cloud were a hit for a Christmas gift for a boy about 2 years in age.  I like that they encourage creative play and stick to the sides of the tub so the area isn't cluttered up for adults using the same bathroom.  Nice packaging and they caught the eye of a friend who is going to get them as a gift for her nephew as well."
"681","3","Was expecting this to be such a fun toy for my inquisitive 2 yr old.  But it requires constant water to be poured to the point that he misses out on all cause & effect of pouring the water.  It really needs a large reservoir so that the child can focus on where the water flows and enjoy that."
"682","5","My kids love taking a cup and dumping water in these during bathtime. They also love the gears."
"683","5","My 2-year-old daughter loves to experiment with all the different pipes, and change the configuration to make the water flow from one to the other. They stick to our cast iron tub and tile wall without a problem, and don't seem to fall off after a month of frequent use. I also like that they are much more easily cleaned that your typical ""squirty"" bath toys that love to grow mold. Yuck!"
"684","3","This is a neat toy and my kid loves it, but the suction cups don't stay stuck to the wall for long and we get frustrated during bathtime when they're constantly popping off!  Also, scares the crap out of us at night if we forget to remove them all after bath and they begin to randomly pop off and fall in the empty tub!  Still, they are really fun"
"685","3","Very cute, but they won't stick on our tiled shower! Once water is poured in, they immediately fall off, making it impossible to create any flow. Our toddler does enjoy just scooping up water and watching it fall through the spinners and twists. But you can't really use the ""pipes"" as intended."
"686","5","The kids(6&2) love these!  They use them in several ways, to blow bubbles, the bed caps can come off so they switch them to see different water flow. The gears don't always work well but the kids have fun and never want to get out of the tub."
"687","1","I absolutely love the idea of these, but they're useless if they cannot stick to the shower wall. Just pulled them out today for my toddlers to play with in the tub, but the suction cups will not stick to the wall. If the suction cups actually worked, this would be five stars."
"688","5","These are great! My kid loves them and they are easy to keep clean and sturdy on the tub."
"689","2","not a great experience, the pipes don't flow into each other well. I tried it and couldn't get a good setup going. Our kids used them once and that was it."
"690","5","Well made, stick well to my tile wall.  Less water makes it through than you may be expecting at first, but it's enough to spin the rotating parts in two of the pipes.  My kids enjoyed playing with this, and the toy is sturdy enough that they didn't break them the first week.  As nice of an item as I could have expected."
"691","3","falls off the wall easily. it's definitely not for 12m+, unless colors catch their eyes. actual play will be after 1.5,2 years of age"
"692","4","The only reason this isn't a 5 is because we're having some trouble getting them to stick solidly to our small bathroom tub tiles. But when they stick, the kids have loads of fun."
"693","3","Much, much better than the gears sold but the same manufacturer. Although these are pricey, I still feel some value is there. The ""t"" shape one lost its suction and fell to the tub's basin, and cracked on one side. We tilt it so the water goes out the other side. The one that should spin doesn't, even with direct pressure from the faucet (see picture). My son is 4 and enjoys building tracks for the water and adjusting them as needed. Pretty great incentive for him to bathe. I'd give the item five stars if I paid half of what they cost me here, so take the three star rating with a grain of salt as your mialige may vary. If you are on the fence on this one, go ahead and purchase them. Just remember to take them off the wall when you done."
"694","1","Great concept- terrible follow through. I was stoked to get these for my little boy but they are a a huge dissappointment. The wont stick to any surface more than a couple seconds. Most times they wont stick at all. They sit in a bucket next to the tub now. Don't use them anymore. Would not purchase again."
"695","5","Hours of play - my son loves this item!  We move them around and make different set ups.  He is 2.5 and gets a kick out of the wheels going round and round"
"696","5","There are great bath toys.  The wheels spin really well, which is not usually the case for bath toys.  My kids have really enjoyed playing with them and building pipe contraptions."
"697","5","My brother-in-law told me that my 3 year-old niece loved these. She loves baths so this was the perfect addition to bath time."
"698","5","Our 2-year-old will play with these for HOURS.  Total hit at our house.  Suction cups work great, good quality plastic."
"699","5","First of all, like other reviewers mentioned, the suction cups don't work very well. But its not enough for me to take away a star, because otherwise these are the most amazing bath toys. My son LOVES them. He prefers to have them in the water with him anyway so he can lift each one up after filling it with water and have the water trickle out over him. If you are really worried about the suction cups working, you may not want to buy this. But if you decide that the suction cups aren't a deal breaker and choose to buy these, be warned, your little one may not want to get out of the bath. You may have to shake one of the pipes out so he or she can carry it around for awhile."
"700","5","Love love love!!!! My kiddos are obsessed with waterfalls so this allows them to make their own right at home in the bath!! So fun"
"701","3","Just opened the box and found that one of the suction cups is defective.  It won't stick and it's just flat.  The other ones stick and if you're a parent of kids like me, you aren't going to have the time to pack everything up and ship it back, especially for a $10 item.  Just going with the 4 and will buy another suction cup when I have time I guess."
"702","5","These have re-invigorated bath time. My 5yo and 2yo both like to play with them and pour the water. The pipes can turn so that you can change the direction the water pours. They're easy to mount on the tile wall and easy to set up in different orientations. A really nice toy."
"703","4","Great for kids who love to pour water in the bath tub! The best pipe is our orange one that has a stronger stream which 'shoots' out more away from the side of the tub. The ones with the wheels don't hold water long enough so they lose my son's attention. I wish more of them were made like the orange tube."
"704","5","These are colorful and fun. Easy to put in place and they stay put. But easy to move around too. Add these with the Cogs water gears and kids love it."
"705","5","I've purchased two sets of these. They will be my go to gift for first birthdays in the future. A very fun bathtub toy for boys or girls. The suction cups work great. Even my six and eight year old enjoy playing with these!"
"706","5","These are so fun for my older kids (6&9), even though I bought for my ten month old.  Our tub wall is a rough, porous tile and they do not stick to it, although they stick to the ceramic tub perfectly.  If you could stack them and run the water through them in a line, it would be even more fun.  Even though we can't, they have more than enough fun with them, pouring the water through and seeing how it comes out.  Its a nice quiet bath toy and can keep them entertained for a long time! I would definitely purchase again and I really don't see any cons to this toy.  I don't feel there would be an issue with it sticking to other tile, maybe just not the rougher kind like we have.I try to be very honest and helpful in my reviews, if it was helpful to you please click yes!"
"707","4","Lots of fun but would lose suction and fall into tub in the middle of the night."
"708","3","Not bad toy, but don<U+2019>t keep attention of a kid.Changing to 3 stars because some pipes are not sticking any more"
"709","5","These are just the coolest toy! They stick great on the side of the tub and provide lots and lots of fun for bathtime!!! I like them as much as the kids!!!"
"710","5","I got this as a present for my 2 year old's birthday. She and her 3 year old brother absolutely love playing with these. They look just like the picture and the suction cup keeps the pipes against the wall and so that they don't slip. The only negative is that the suction cup works almost too well and the kids have a hard time pulling them off of the wall."
"711","3","I ordered this for my son for Christmas. One of the pipes has a deformed suction cup and won't stick to anything. Unfortunately, these aren't your standard suction cups that I could swap out so only 4/5 pipes are usable.  He does enjoy the ones that work."
"712","5","Love these! So much fun for my son. The suction cups stick well but occasionally pop off at random times since we just leave them on the wall when he's not in the bath."
"713","4","Setting these up can be tricky, but i,have even played with them while my babe was in the tub, relaxing"
"714","5","These are so cool! My daughter loves them and so do I! They stick really well and are easy to wipe down."
"715","5","My kids love these.  Both my 2 and 5 year old think they are very fun and they work well on our medium tiled bath wall.  They will not stick on grouted parts of the wall, so they would not be compatible with small tiles."
"716","5","These bath toys are awesome! I bought them for my 1 yr old for bath time. She's a little young get but she's starting to get the concept of pouring the water in. She loves to hold her hand underneath and touch the water as it flows out. These are a great alternative to just a floating duck or two. Love!"
"717","3","Grandson played with them one time in the tub then wanted his usual, regular bath toys back. Nice concept tho."
"718","5","Great tub entertainment! So far, no mold. I do leave them out to dry overnight before putting them away."
"719","1","Neat idea, poorly designed. Does not work as advertised. My 2 year old was over it after one bath."
"720","4","Toddler was interested in playing with the pipes. But I wish the tubes were longer and could hold more water to extend the reaction time. The tubes only hold perhaps a few tablespoons of water and my toddler can only watch the gears spin for a few seconds before it's over."
"721","1","This item arrived in a torn up box. The toys had already been removed from the cardboard backing. Gross."
"722","5","My kids want to stay in the tub forever now!  They love arranging these in different ways.  Great product!"
"723","1","Great idea but they don't stick to our bathroom tile in the tub area. I wish I could return but threw the box away before making sure they work."
"724","5","This is by far the best bath toy ever! I have bought this as presents for my friends with kids and as well my kids too! Endless entertainment.  We'll made and easy to clean!"
"725","4","I confess this was a bit of a splurge when it comes to bath toys, but my daughter loves these little pipes. She<U+2019>s played with them every day since they arrived. Very entertaining and the quality is good too. The suction cups hold ok."
"726","5","Really cute. They work really well when water is poured them. One note. They will not stick to our textured tile on the walls. They stick nicely to the tub."
"727","4","My ceramic tub doesn't allow suction cups to stay in place for very long.  Kind of disappointing but not the products fault.  My 2 year likes them and plays with them, just not as much as some of her other toys.  If I had tile or iron tub I'd probably order two sets and play with myself while supervising bath time."
"728","4","My daughter likes them, keeps her occupied.  They don't really stick to the tile wall above her tub, but they're not smooth finished tiles.  However, they do stick to the tub itself very well."
"729","5","Very cool, they are infinity configurable, allowing the pipes to be turned to different angles, some of them turn on/off, etc. It's great for my 3 and 1.5 year olds and I'm guessing they'll still be playing with them in a couple years, but will be doing much more interesting things with them."
"730","4","These stay suctioned to the tub, my son has enjoyed playing with them at bath time and it is fun to re-arrange them. I like that they are not a toy that is constantly submerged in water so they don't become slimy or stinky like many bath toys. Something different & fun."
"731","4","My daughter loves bathtime and she really likes these pipes. The quality is okay. I<U+2019>m deducting a star because the orange one we received does not work. The force of the water falling won<U+2019>t make it spin. My daughter is only 2 but she knows enough to ignore the one that doesn<U+2019>t work."
"732","5","My 5yr old and 1 1/2yr old enjoy these during bath time. The older one likes to positions them to pour on the Boon cog wheels (a different set). My younger pours and spins by hand happily."
"733","5","Bath time with these has been a great way to keep the kiddos entertained. My two little ones love bath time,and withe these toys, they dont want to leave the tub."
"734","5","2 and 4 year old love these pipes!  Kids love transferring water from one cup to another which also means water all over the floor.  These pipes help keep the water in the tub! Can't go wrong with the Boon bath toys!"
"735","5","Fun bath toy for my 2yr old! She loves these and easy to move and place on tub. We used with other bath toys! Tons of fun. Pricy but in my opinion worth it!"
"736","5","LOVE these! They are THE favorite bath toy every time with my 3 and 4 year old. Well made and no issues with the suction cup."
"737","5","These are so much fun!! Our kids love them! .. Not gonna lie, I have had fun playing with them too! The colors are so vibrant and they stick to our textured bath-tub walls well, even though most water toys don't."
"738","5","Our 2 year old was resisting bath time and we got these little bath pipes to make it more fun. A great distraction for a tired 2 year old!"
"739","4","not the best bath toy, but my baby likes them. Hopefully she will learn how to use them as a unit, making water flow from one pipe to another (it requires adult help to see them function well). She mainly uses them individually."
"740","2","Our bathtub has the slightest bit of texture and these fall right off. Even on the wall with no texture, they fall right out. Would not recommend for kids easily frustrated. Suction cups are really low quality."
"741","5","Bought these for my 2 year old who loves to play with cups in the bathtub. She and her almost 5 year old sister love these!"
"742","5","Got these for my five year old son over 6 months ago and he is still enjoying them.  They are well made and the suction cups are great quality - will stay stuck for months."
"743","5","What fun bath toys!!! My son might be too young (just turned 3) so he's not super creative but I have fun with them while he's in the bath!!! I think he will enjoy them more as he is older."
"744","2","I don't like these very much. The water doesn't flow out that well and the ones with wheels don't really turn. The only reason I didn't give one star is because my son got some enjoyment out of them."
"745","4","my grand kids took them home so i don't know if they liked them or not .they don't live near me"
"746","5","These are great time for the bath! Even more fun it you put the bath tub color drops in the cups and the watch  the different colors come down the tubes and dye the bath water."
"747","3","The Boon Pipes Water Pipes Bath Toy will not stick to my bathtub. My daughter was very disappointed because they really do look fun. I am giving 3 stars because the issue may be due to the type of tub that I have."
"748","5","These are great! I like to stick them to the wall and create systems. My toddler likes to pour water back and forth while holding them. Clearly they're good for all ages!"
"749","4","The green one doesn<U+2019>t auction well. Cute kids like it. Wonder how long will take for it to mold."
"750","5","SUCH a great bath toy. My 5 year old daughter loves them and I must admit to spending an embarrassingly long amount of time playing with them myself and getting all the variations of paths working!! Great idea for a very reasonable price."
"751","3","The vertical 'turbine' doesn<U+2019>t turn when filled with water. It's not that it's stuck but the water pressure just isn<U+2019>t enough to turn it. They should have tested that during design. Also, there's no way to combine the pipes together into some sort of a 'pipeline' with water flowing from one pipe to another. The dimensions of the pipes don<U+2019>t let you do that easily. I wish that was added to the design. So overall it's a solidly built product that will keep your toddler interested for a week or two."
"752","5","My 3 year old love the pipes. He always looks forward to bath time. Great quality."
"753","5","My kids really love these (ages 7, 4, and 18 months). The plastic seems to be good quality, not flimsy. The suction cups work well. They keep the pipes on the wall during bath time, and even up to a day or two later."
"754","4","Wish there were more than just 5.  Other than that they work great and make fun ""machines"", esp. with the cogs."
"755","4","The idea of it is cool. My kiddo is too young to appreciate them though."
"756","5","My two year old loves these. They are open-ended and there are lots of different ways to play with them and ""water experiments"" she can do. She requests to play with them even when she's not in the tub! These would make a great gift."
"757","2","Returned. Didn't really make any sense... Kids thought it was dumb"
"758","5","Such fun bath toys! They are cute, stay put, and entertain my daughter during her bath!"
"759","3","A little disappointed one of our pipes won't stay sticking onto our wall bc the suction cup is messed up. The concept is cool but it just isn't the quality I was hoping for."
"760","5","These are the COOLEST bath toys ever! My 3 year old son loves them. I love them too. They're fun! Good quality, suction cups stay where you put them but aren't too difficult to move."
"761","4","These are pretty neat.  I have to agree that the water passes quickly through a couple of them.  The kids love them, though, including a 19 mo old who is learning to pour.  Colorful and I ordered a second set as a gift."
"762","5","my 3yr old and 1 yr old love these. going to buy another set to make it even bigger!"
"763","4","The boon pipes water pipes are a lot of fun. My son and I love playing with them at bath time. The colors are nice and bright. He really enjoys seeing all the moving pieces and loves to stick them and unstick them from the wall. We were having a hard time with bath time and since getting these pipes, he has been more entertained.  We got these on prime and it was great receiving these so quick."
"764","5","My daughter loves bath time so we look for anything cool that she can play with in the tub and these definitely rank high on my list. These are designed very well and develop creative thinking because there are tons of ways to set them up. The only complaint I have is that they are pretty big in size so you can't get more than two of them high inside a garden tub. If you have a shower tub with full wall on the back you have alot more possibilities but still very cool."
"765","4","These are just okay.  My toddler loves pouring but was not interested in these for a while. She is starting to warm up to them and like them.  There aren't that many toys out there that do anything besides just float or squirt so I was looking forward to some fun with these. There are two pipes with spinning things in them. One of them doesn't work - the piece is slightly too big or tight.  She loves the one that turns like a paddle wheel.  The other three just have water that comes out of a small holes at the bottom.  I like these. I just wish there was a tad bit more variety to them then water just coming out the bottom of them.  Overall, I think I'd get these again or as a gift. They are good when kids like to pour and fill and dump little cups of water."
"766","5","Fun toy. Great for learning to pour & exploring what the different tubes do. Pretty colors."
"767","3","It sticks to our tub but not to the shower tiles on the wall.  Fun for our 2 year old."
"768","5","I bought these for my daughter.  She is still too young to use them but my 4 year old nephews love them!  They stick to the wall really well but are easily movable by children."
"769","5","Husband is a piping engineer so when I saw these I had to get them for our son who loves them! Our daughter too! Definitely makes bath time more fun getting to pour water down them."
"770","5","These keep my daughter busy the whole bath! She loves to rearrange them around the tub to make them pour into each other. Great investment for Beth time fun!"
"771","5","Oh my gosh! Both grandsons are enjoying this! One is 8 months, the other 2 1/2 - and they bathe together. It is lots of fun, and sticks well to the tub. The boys don't complain about bath time, knowing this delightful toy is waiting for them."
"772","4","The really interesting pieces are the two with wheels. The rest are a bit boring."
"773","3","Smaller than I thought and don't flow like the video. They're okay."
"774","4","My 1 1/2 grandson loves it and it is a regular part of his bath ritual."
"775","4","My kids love all the different ways water comes out of the tubes but these don't stick to the tile in our bathroom because the tiles aren't smooth enough. So we had to stick them to the tub itself. Maybe using sturdier suction cups would help."
"776","5","love these.  they stick to the tub so that water can poor through. some spin others poor out.  lots of bath time fun."
"777","5","These bath toys are great! It keeps my son busy and keeps his mind going because you can situate and move them all over to create different obstacles. They are easy to move and use."
"778","2","Kids thought it would be a lot cooler, it<U+2019>s not"
"779","5","These are one of a kind.  I wish I had these when I was growing up.  They are all really cool and my child loves them so much.  It makes bath time more fun."
"780","3","These seem pretty sturdy and well-made, but they won't stick AT ALL on our barely textured plastic tub/surround. I find this pretty frustrating, but my daughter still enjoys hooking them together and scooping water through them to see what happens. So they're still played with, even though the suction cup feature is worthless for us."
"781","4","I got these for my youngest niece (1.5 years old) and go figure the two older kids wanted to play with them more than the baby. Fun addition to bath time but they do fall off sometimes."
"782","5","My son absolutely loves this and they stick very well to the tub."
"783","5","Something so simple provides soooooo much fun.  My four year old asks to take his bath early to leave more time to play with ""the pipes"" Five stars for making bathtime fun for him and easier for mom!"
"784","5","I bought this product again as a gift for my nephew. After two years, my grandson still plays with them every day!"
"785","2","disappointing, even for some very creative kids"
"786","2","Didn<U+2019>t flow as smoothly as I had hoped. Little<U+2019>s loaf interest because they were too difficult to work and align just perfectly with the gears made by this company as well. It<U+2019>s a lot of work to get everything moving together and had much higher hopes for these."
"787","2","Do not all work, some leak and do not stream into one another"
"788","3","Not as exciting as I thought, hard to get a good water flow, water kind of just dribbles out.  Great idea, just not executed very well.  Should have much larger tubes and resevouir to get a better flow."
"789","5","These are great bath toys! My 3 yr old loves them"
"790","2","These are pretty <U+201C>meh<U+201D>. My kiddo loves bath time, pouring and splashing is the name of his game so I was really excited to get these. Some of them have such close contact between the toy, auction cup, and wall that they don<U+2019>t spin and others are just.... <U+201C>meh.<U+201D> I say save your money."
"791","5","My 3 and a half year old daughter loves these. She plays with them in the shower. The colors varied slightly, but thats okay with me. Strong suction cups keep them on the wall of the shower securely."
"792","3","Wish they connected more and can use to build versus each doing their own thing"
"793","5","These were given as a gift to my two year old.  She loves them!  It is a very fun, interactive bath toy.  Different then all the other toys you normally see.  I bought them as a gift for another two year old!"
"794","2","They don't stick to our pretty normal bath surround, and the Orange one came broken :("
"795","1","The toy looked great but the suction cups did not work well. They kept on falling off the wall...even when they were firmly pressed on. It is a defect in the design. I was very disappointed...and I bought TWO of them for different grandchildren :((((("
"796","5","Another great Boon product!  My kids have been building little networks of pipes in the tub since we got these!  They have a really good time figuring out how to put them together in different configurations.  These stick well to my fiberglass tub."
"797","4","The white pipe spinner tends to fall out on our set and overall the set leaves much to be desired the way the water falls through at a very slow pace, but otherwise a great toy."
"798","3","Good idea. Not all pices stay on the wall, some just fall off."
"799","5","Kids like playing with them in the tub.  Good suction cups.  No complaints."
"800","3","These are ok. The white pipe doesn't work at all, and other ones run slow. Not as much fun as the munchkin bath falls toys, which are cheaper. Would recommend those over these pipes."
"801","5","Bought these as a gift for a 3 yr old, and he loves them!  Keeps him in the bathtub longer.  Also bought the Boon Cogs - great combination for fun in the tub."
"802","5","I bought this for my 2 year old son's birthday. He loves these and hasn't figured out the best way to put the water in the top but with a litle help during bathtime, he has a blast."
"803","5","These pipes are tons of fun for the littles in the tub. My kids could spend hours putting them together in different ways and playing with them. Great purchase!"
"804","5","I love this brand! Products are amazing, my 33 months old son loves to play with this toys and makes bath time joyfull"
"805","5","Christmas gift for my two year old niece. The pipes arrived as described and appear to be of good quality. She has been playing with them in the bath tub since Christmas."
"806","4","Lots of fun.  I think if we had a shower stall to play in, or a different sort of wall (if we are not carefully the tiles pull off) we'd like these even more.  But they are really fun."
"807","4","Bought for grandchild. Review from parents was that it worked great and she loves bath time."
"808","5","My grandaughter loves these bath toys!"
"809","5","My son is IN LOVE with these! He's 2 and they keep him busy during bath and I feel they'll grow with him which is something I look for in toys"
"810","5","Great bath toys! My 1 year old son likes to spin the wheels while my 5 year old daughter likes to set it up and pour water through. Simple yet great for all ages glad we purchased these."
"811","4","I expected to have them run into each other, but it is difficult because each tube has a different outlet."
"812","1","I'm shocked these have such good reviews. Bought these and they were delivered Sunday. Within the first 30 seconds of putting them on my smooth and clean tiles they fell. For a few days I continued to attempt placing them on the tiles, the tub siding, wetting the suction cups, all kinds of different methods and they still fell within 1-2 minutes of putting them up. The idea is great and they are so cute and educational but you can't really use them like you should. Big disappointment!"
"813","1","Be aware before purchasing <U+2014> Not all the suction works.  Disappointed."
"814","5","My grandson loved it...so I loved it!"
"815","3","These are super cool and fun, but some of the suction cups didn't work straight out of the packaging. I love how you could easily combine multiple sets of these."
"816","2","Wonderful concept. However the suction cups are horrible. They do not stick to the wall once you begin to pour water through them."
"817","1","Poor quality for the price. Seems like something you could get at the dollar store. They won't stick to the wall. The parts that move don't move smoothly."
"818","4","i wish they came with a pouring cup, but really... i love them. you can mix and match and get creative, and there is nowhere for mildew! plus they make great horns for music making :)"
"819","4","Hard to stick on tub. Better for wall"
"820","5","My 2 and 5 year old love these bath toys. Well made, suctions work great"
"821","5","My daughter is two.  She loves these!!!  She plays with them every night in the bath.  Very well made, suctions well to our tile.  No complaints."
"822","5","My 4 year old son looooooved it and played with it every time he goes bathing. Actually he is very excited now to know he can go into bath, so he can play with these toys again."
"823","5","These tubes are great! Such a fun addition to the tub. My my girls ages 1 and 5 love these and love filling them up and making new ways to stick them together!"
"824","4","The Orange one never stays stuck to the tub/wall for more than a couple minutes, but other than that they're super fun. Been using them for 3 months now with not much wear and tear to them."
"825","5","My boys love it!!! Makes bath time fun. Will order another set."
"826","5","We have slightly textured bathtub/tiles so they only stay on for a few minutes but my son loves them and doesn't mind putting them back up."
"827","5","My 2 year old son plays with these every time he takes a bath. It keeps him busy while I give him a bath. He enjoys pouring the water and watching the spinner spin. He positions the pipes himself.  Love it!"
"828","5","Kids had a blast with this toy in the bath. The suction holds well."
"829","3","The design is good. The white one somehow is very hard to turn. We have to pure water really hard to make it move."
"830","3","I wanted to love these- but they aren<U+2019>t my (or my baby<U+2019>s) favorite."
"831","3","Not in love with the water mechanics of these. Slow flow helps a cup of water last longer but for the price should have more variety."
"832","5","My two year old son loves playing with these at bath time. He quickly figured out how they work and loves putting water through them. Highly recommended!"
"833","5","Super fun bath toy. Really keeps my almost 4 year old entertained."
"834","4","Easy for little hands to play with during bath time. They quickly figured out how the suction cups work! Only problem was it didn't stick to the tile shower wall so well, but stuck to iron tub just fine."
"835","5","My 11 month old loves these."
"836","2","They don't stick on the tile too well and when they do I can guarantee they'll fall off around my sons bedtime. Super annoying. I should've returned it but felt bad. My son doesn't really play with them either."
"837","5","cute, the suction cups stick well to the tub (so far). I think I have more fun with these than my daughter! :) They are easy to clean too."
"838","5","I purchased these not sure my son would like them. Was pleasantly surprised that he plays with them every bath time, nice step up from baby to toddler bath toys."
"839","3","Eh...they don't stick onto the shower wall  like they should and the green twist swivel one gets stuck all the time. Its an okay product."
"840","5","Fun for my 3 year-old and 18 month old."
"841","5","Perfect wall toy for the bath and it keeps kids busy!"
"842","4","These are great! I got these for my almost two year old to try and motivate him to NOT pour water out of the tub. While my goal isn't 100% achieved, he doesn't dump water out for as much of bath time as he did before. These are also fun to turn the lights out and use glowsticks with. Put a glowstick in one of the colored tubes under water and the whole bath turns colors!"
"843","5","My 2 year old loves these! They keep him entertained all during bath time. I like that they are easy to store and clean easy!"
"844","5","5 stars, excellent product! Better than expected!!!  Highly recommended item."
"845","5","pretty neat- can't wait to give it to my 11 month old for Christmas!"
"846","4","Please note, these water pipes allow you to twist the ends so that water can be blocked and released.  If your water is not flowing from pipe to pipe, and one pipe is above the other, check to make sure the pipes are twisted open.Sadly, the suction cups only work on our tub but not on our tiled walls.  This is certainly not the fault of the product.  Yet, I have to dock it one star because I cannot actually test it properly and cannot say if it merits 5 stars as a result.  If suction cups stick to your walls, then these pipes can be a lot of fun. My 5 year old plays with them even though we don't have enough space to use them properly (with water in the bath, and only being able to stick them on the tub, there is no room between the wall and the water line)."
"847","4","Got these for my son for bath time and he loves them. The suction is good too, unlike many of the bath products we have bought that always fall off."
"848","2","It would be ok if the orange tube's spinner did not get stuck against the bathtub.  It fits too close to the bathtub wall. It cannot spin. The white one pictured has no spinner like the pic either. Water barley trickles out of some of these."
"849","4","Simple and nice. Suction cups don't always hang long, but good enough for a bath session."
"850","5","Just what I wanted.  Purchased as a gift so not sure about performance.  Quality looks good so expectations high."
"851","5","these are perfect for the bath my granddaughter loves them"
"852","4","the kids love themreckon thats good enough"
"853","4","My 15 month old doesn<U+2019>t even notice they are there. Maybe when he<U+2019>s older he<U+2019>ll notice them."
"854","5","My 14 mo old daughter loves these even though she doesn't quite understand leaving them on the wall yet! They are easy to pull down without worrying about breaking the suction cup, and they're colorful and eye catching."
"855","5","You can't go wrong with any of the boon bath toys. My son loves these and I'm a happy mom bc they don't hold water! We had to toss all our bath toys due to mold. The boon toys have been a great replacement!"
"856","1","These are a great idea, but they don<U+2019>t stay on the wall."
"857","4","my 4 year old and 2 year old boys love it.  however, I bought two packages and one of them came with defects (the wheels in the pipe would not turn).  I had to ask Amazon for replacement."
"858","5","My two-year old granddaughter loves playing with these in the bathub!"
"859","2","Item came incomplete. My fan for the white tube was missing"
"860","5","Its an awesome bath toy but might not stick to all surfaces well."
"861","5","I used it for outdoor water play and the kids loved it. They would take it off the wall and use it to try to scoop up water from the water table. Which is fine. :) The quality is nice and it's not too hard to clean. The thicker parts in the photos can be turned to control the water output and how it falls.. which is great for children's fine motor skills. It'd be nicer if the pipes were a bit longer in length."
"862","3","My son really likes these, but they all fall off the bath or tiles within a minute. I have tried on many different surfaces and the suction cups are not that strong."
"863","4","We love these buy they don't suction to parts of our tub that are textured. It really needs a smooth surface to suction to"
"864","5","A big hit! Simple and engaging fun. We leave them attached and all the other toys are old news."
"865","3","Great idea, but not quite what I wanted. Like other users have said, they don't stick too well. They all fall multiple times during bath time."
"866","5","Upon opening the present our son immediately said ""I want to take a bath"". They're wonderful. He plays with them every night."
"867","2","The fall off the bathroom wall so much. I'm constantly hearing loud clunks in the bathroom. If they had better suction they'd be great."
"868","4","Fun for bath time. I find them entertaining myself."
"869","5","very good bath toys that are easy to keep clean, no worry about mold in them because you can see through them clearly, and water cannot sit when not in use."
"870","5","Got here for my 2 year old and he loves them! Great buy!"
"871","4","works well on shower door, but not so much on natural tile."
"872","3","Thought my kids (2 and 6) would love these based on reviews but they just don't hold their interest. Seem like good quality though."
"873","1","The suction cups don't work on our tile walls and barely stick to the tub."
"874","5","Loads of fun for my 4 year old grandson.  My 17 month old granddaughter also loves poring water in and out of each unit undividually as well.Highly recommended"
"875","5","My almost 2 year old loooooves these!"
"876","5","My boys are 2 and 4, they love playing with these tubes in the tub. Suction cups stick very well, the green one doesn't spin really well but overall very good quality."
"877","4","Kids think they<U+2019>re kind of fun"
"878","5","Very fun and well made"
"879","5","My 2 year old son loves to play with these in the bath. I had been looking for toys that didn't hold water and needed to be thrown away. These are great!"
"880","4","My 2 year old likes these. One of the tubes doesn't work super well but it is still a fun toy for him to play with. And it helps prevent him from dumping water on the floor"
"881","5","My son just loves this bath toy, lots of thinking involved on where to put each one..and how the water makes some of the parts move. Definitely makes bath time more fun!"
"882","2","It is such a cute idea, but ours didn<U+2019>t stick."
"883","5","My kids were getting bored with same old bath toys.  We bought these along with gears and some new bath crayons and color tabs and my kids can't get enough.  They were asking for two baths a day!"
"884","4","My kids love these.  I just wish that you could connect the pipes to each other."
"885","5","My grandson loves these it keeps him occupied for a long time in the bathtub. He can change the flow by moving the pipes in different directions"
"886","5","Our two year old loves these, as he gets older he tries to stack them and create waterfall effects.  They are very engaging for a little one."
"887","5","These are so fun! My kids love them. And maybe mom and dad play with them a little sometimes too. ;)"
"888","4","I like them, my toddler likes them but doesn't understand then yet"
"889","5","Nice product, lots of fun."
"890","5","Great bath fun. I have twin boys so I have two sets of these and two sets of the gears."
"891","3","These would be better if they connected together. Otherwise, they are fine."
"892","4","My 1 and 3 year old love these!"
"893","5","Fun for bath time with my toddlers."
"894","5","These are so much fun! My daughter loves them and plays with them every bath time. Would recommend if you child loves to use cups to dump water in the tub."
"895","5","These are great for toddlers and school age kiddos. Endless combinations. Teaches them about cause and effect too!"
"896","5","My kids love these!  They stick very well to the bathtub wall, and clean easily.  We use them outside of the bathtub as well, for the kiddy pool and for ""experiments.""  Well made; 2 toddlers pulling on these and nary a break yet!"
"897","2","suction is pretty poor"
"898","5","Excellent, especially with Boon Gears!"
"899","5","These are sturdy fun bathtub toys for kids 6 months and older.  I would buy these again."
"900","2","The suction part on some of the pieces came damaged so it would not stick. My son doesn<U+2019>t really care for them."
"901","1","stay away , they dont have good suction at all, falls, and they can not be interconnected to each other."
"902","3","My 2.5 year old didn't show.much interest in this toy. It does do as described, but I guess in reality it is not as exciting as it seems online. Sorry."
"903","5","Love these! Had no problems of them falling down a lot like others did. Would like them to be a little more ""connectable"" so my kid could connect 3 or 4 of them in a row. Think that would be really neat."
"904","2","this will only stick to flat surfaces which is not most tile work.something i didnt think about! it sticks to my tub but it would be better if you can have them pour into each other. And the tub isnt deep enough."
"905","5","Just purchased for my 2 year old son, he liked them right away & couldn<U+2019>t wait to get into the tub to try them! He had a lot of fun discovering how they work & saying bye-bye to the water. I like that a few drain quickly & a few slowly. Very happy with my purchase!"
"906","3","These are fun but they keep on falling off"
"907","5","The coolest bath toy ever!  Only problem is I want another set to make a whole wall of pipes, but my kids are still a little young to set them up themselves....soooo...I wait."
"908","5","My boys, 6 & 3, enjoy these a lot!"
"909","2","These are a fun idea, but I had a hard time getting them to stick. Kid likes them though!"
"910","5","My son got these when he was 2.  He's three now and this is still his favorite bath toy.  He'll spend forever dumping water into them and making different formations."
"911","5","Went from having to convince her to stay in more than a minute to her playing and playing. Seems particularly good for the stage where hair washing gets scary for the little ones."
"912","5","Great for kids to learn about the properties of water and play in the bath.For the kids, it's been the favorite bath toy in our house for 2+ weeks now, which is a record as far as bath toys go..."
"913","5","My kid absolutely loves these. He`s having 30 min longer bath times now"
"914","3","In concept they are fun, however they rarely stay in place.  The suction cups are not as effective as I would like to hold up to children."
"915","5","Lots of fun"
"916","5","Lots of fun.  I plan on ordering a second set to accompany these at christmas.  The ends turn to all you to adjust water flow and change direction."
"917","4","Cute little bath toy"
"918","5","We love these!! We always get these for 1st birthday gifts!"
"919","5","These are amazing!!!! Our son just turned 4yo and he is absolutely obsessed with these!  So fun. We use in the bathtub!  Highly recommend!!  A++++++++"
"920","5","fun for the kids"
"921","5","Keeps my little ones busy in the bath. I like that they can be mounted on the wall by suction cups as opposed to floating around in the tub collecting mildew."
"922","5","My daughter thinks these are great!  Fun to connect them, and they don<U+2019>t get grimey like other bath toys."
"923","4","Pleased with purchase"
"924","5","Toddler loves these and they stick to the bath very well!"
"925","5","Over year old and still work grear"
"926","3","I really love these wish they were just a little bit better made some of the tubes fill up too quick not enough space to hold water for the paddles and some of them slightly leak where the caps have been snapped in but other than that I have as much fun with them as my son does"
"927","5","Having fun @ bathtime!!!!! These keeps them busy and entertained for quite of a time."
"928","5","fun and easy to use. small lever makes it easy to unsuction. worked great and easy for small hands."
"929","4","my two year likes them they work pretty good,the suction cups on the back of the only thing that I have a problem with they fall off the wall after about 5 mins."
"930","3","Meh..."
"931","5","These are a huge hit at bath time!  The pieces are easy enough for my 3 and 6 year olds to set up, take apart and rearrange.  Perfect bath toy!"
"932","5","Absolutely one of the best buys I've done! Both boys love these toys (2 and 7 yo) to the point I'm debating about getting another set!"
"933","5","Great toys for kids."
"934","5","Finally something that keeps him interested in the tub. They stick well, we will see how long they hold up to his rough play."
"935","4","It was kindof more boring than I thought, unfortunately. One of the wheels doesn't spin so that one just trickles out the side."
"936","5","2 year old loves these!"
"937","3","Great concept but do not stick to wall well at all."
"938","4","These are decent toys. They keep my kids occupied in the bathtub, but there isn't anything super special about them. Overall, decent purchase."
"939","5","Great bath toys!! My kids favorite!"
"940","4","These are a cute set of pipes that all drain differently."
"941","5","Great gift for my nephew!"
"942","3","These are fun but they don't stick well to the bath wall. My daughters like to make chain reactions with them but sometimes they all fall down on them which is uh, surprising sometimes.:p"
"943","5","These have made my sons bath time more fun. They love playing with them. They are also very good quality!"
"944","5","My kids absolutely love these (5 year old and 2 year old.) Great buy and will buy for other kids' birthdays."
"945","5","I bought two of these one for each of my kids 1 and 7 and both of them loved them!"
"946","5","These are great and the kids love playing with them in the tub!"
"947","5","grand kids present and I hear they play with it a lot."
"948","5","<U+00A0>I purchased these pipes for my 2.5 year old boy who is obsessed with spinning objects (helicopters, ceiling fans, etc).  Although only two of the pipes have spinners, they are all fun to him.  We have uneven tile surfaces in the bathroom and I found that I have to hold each suction cup (there is 1 suction cup per pipe) against the wall for 15 seconds and they will hold at least overnight.  There is the possibility to stagger these pipes on the wall to get more of a continuous flow/waterfall effect from pipe to pipe, although some pipes do not allow for a fast water flow out of the bottom so you have to be wise about the placement of the pipes.  I like that these pipes allow for air flow due to the holes, as I don't think they will get moldy over time.  Overall I have been pleased with this purchase."
"949","4","Was expecting to work better"
"950","5","These pipes were a big hit!  Even my 13-year old thinks they are interesting.  They look cool too and are well made."
"951","5","Fairly priced and exactly as expected. 3+4 year olds enjoy these."
"952","5","Great for Bath Time.  There are enough pieces to keep multiple kids entertained during bath time.  Several parts that move as water runs through.  We should have bought this long ago."
"953","5","These are a huge hit in the bathtub. So much better then other toys because water can't get inside them !"
"954","5","My daughter loves playing with these in the bath tub."
"955","5","These are great quality and work really well! Our boys (four and 1.5) love playing with them in the tub.  The suction cups adhere and stay attached forever.  I think I read a review before purchasing that claimed they were not see-through, but they are.  It's fun to watch the water shoot out and to create different combinations.  Wonderful buy!"
"956","5","My son loves this toy. Doesn't want to get out of the bath because he loves playing with it so much"
"957","5","This is the single greatest bath toy ever invented. My kids didn<U+2019>t want to stop playing. Each pipe has a different spout so the water comes out differently and you can align the pipes to pour into each other or play with them individually. Great price for a super awesome product."
"958","5","Good quality.  My 3 yr old and 18 mo old loved playing with these outside.  We attached them into some plexiglass on the back patio."
"959","4","Cute toy set,  only complaint is that one doesn't spin the way it's supposed to.  Been like that since it came out of the box."
"960","2","Kids are not sure what to do with these.  They provide minimal entertainment.  They stick to the wall pretty well."
"961","3","These are great quality, fun colors, and look like they'd be so much fun to use. But the suction cups don't stick to our tile tub surround."
"962","5","These are the BEST bath toys! I might like them more than my daughter. I love how she can explore and investigate while taking a bath."
"963","5","My two kids (two and under) really enjoy these toys during bath time.  I would recommend to others."
"964","5","These are for the 2 year old, but I love playing with them while she's in the tub and she loves to help!"
"965","5","These are awesome! My 5 & 2 year old love these. Lots of combination possibilities to keep my 5 year olds attention & every 2 year old loves to dump water right?!?!"
"966","5","Fun."
"967","5","This is a unique bath toy which is refreshing from all of the typical squirters that just collect mold.  My 3 year old really enjoys the different things she can do with these."
"968","4","Lots of fun for my 2 and 4 year old. Love the colors and design. One star removed because one pipe is defective."
"969","2","For how much I paid for these I am not sure they are worth it. My son does like them but looses interest pretty fast because the pipes don't hold much water in them and the water goes right through them. Also the way some of the pipes are constructed is off, there are spaces on the pipes where the water just runs out and doesn't go out the hole it is supposed to."
"970","5","My nephew loves these!!!"
"971","5","Great purchase! My kids love this toy! We have it for over a year and it still sticks easily on the bath wall and looks brand new."
"972","3","Great but don't stick easy but lots of fun for the time they are stuck."
"973","4","My son loves these, and they are pretty clever. Just wish they were easier to clean (mold phobia here)"
"974","5","These are so cool. I threw out all of the squirting toys because they get so gross when water gets trapped inside. These were a much better replacement."
"975","2","Some of the plastic that auctions to the tub have manufacturing flaws which makes the toy unable to attach to tub. 2 out of the 5"
"976","5","So cute and bigger than I thought!"
"977","5","My 4 year old LOVES these. Great display of cause and effect. Suction cups work well. It is a fun toy! We ordered a second to give as a gift to another child who admired them when visiting."
"978","4","Great concept. My toddler loves them. However...they don't stick well. They are constantly falling off the side of the tub and tile. Therefore, I give 4 stars."
"979","5","So much fun for bath time! My son really enjoys playing with these whether they be on the wall of the bathtub or just floating around in the water."
"980","3","THey are nice, but... We bought 2 sets and for some reason the blades spin much more freely in one set than the other."
"981","5","My son loves to play with these in the tub!"
"982","3","The suctions only suction to the bathtub wall, or the glass in the shower.  They will not suction to the tile in the tub area.  So it makes it hard for the kids to play with them while having a bath since they can't make a big chain of the pipes to flow into each other."
"983","5","Using them every night. These will not stick well to porous tile, but do fine in the tub.  My kids find different ways to entertain themselves with these every night."
"984","5","These are the coolest bath toys ever.  My 20 month old and my 7 year old enjoy these pipes and they make bath time fun and exciting."
"985","5","My son loves it and doesn't cry when going for shower."
"986","4","The suction isn't as strong as other toys. My kids still like them."
"987","4","Very cute idea. But they don't hold much water so it spills out the top more than out the bottom holes. But if you use a smaller cup, probably works better."
"988","5","Great bath toy that doesn't catch mold..."
"989","4","Both of my boys, age 1 and 4 very much enjoy these... But none of the tubes hold much water... I ended up ordering a second set, one for each kid."
"990","4","Son likes these but the suction could be a little better"
"991","2","Cheaply made & too small to hold a toddler's interest."
"992","3","Fun in the tub, wish it came with a ball. It's something different from squirters and moldy blocks."
"993","5","Love this"
"994","2","Barely stay on sides of bath. Water barely dribbles through. Waste of money"
"995","5","We got these for our16 month old granddaughter and she LOVES them.  They are easy to turn and also fairly easy for her to take off and put on.  If  your little one enjoys gadgety things, they will love these pipes."
"996","5","We have really enjoyed these toys. They have helped bath time go more smoothly in our house. So far these are the best bath toys we<U+2019>ve found. We do tip them upside down after bath to clear water out."
"997","5","Water loving granddaughter enjoys them.  One of the pieces doesn't turn like it should when water is poured through, but they are still a hit."
"998","5","Better than I expected! My 3 and almost 2 year old didn't want to leave the bath. Really cute toy!"
"999","5","My grandson loves these! So cute!"
"1000","5","My 3 year old loves these tubes! It's only 5 pieces and they look so simple, but he has a blast with them."
"1001","5","My 2yr old son will stand for hours in the tub just pouring water down these things.  He hasn't figured out they will move around on the wall yet but when he does... I'm assured of hours of more fun for him!"
"1002","5","Super cute and creative. My one year old loves them."
"1003","3","I wish the suction cups on these were as big as the gears. They fall down a lot when the water gets poured in them."
"1004","3","Pretty fun. Doesn't stick to tile though. Only ceramic, plastic, glass."
"1005","3","It's ok.  My 6 year old son played with it only a few times."
"1006","5","The kids love these we have had them for over 2 years already."
"1007","5","So much fun I think I look forward to playing with this more than my toddler. We will spend a good amount t of time creating and pouring water and challenging the streams and connections."
"1008","4","Not every spinning wheel worked perfectly but my daughter still loves playing with them."
"1009","5","Very cool set of bath toys!  Quickly became a favorite of my twin boys (3yo).  Highly recommend!"
"1010","5","Fantastic bath toy! My son is 19 months and loves playing with these."
"1011","5","Bought these for both my son (2 years old) and my nephews (3 and 5 years old) and they all love them!"
"1012","5","These are amazing! My 2 yr old loves them! Goes GREAT with the Boon brand ""gears"" bath toys.. they match and work well together! Great buy"
"1013","5","My 2 and 3-year-olds love these! They are fun to rearrange and watch the water flow differently. The suction cups are easy to take on and off the wall. Makes bath time even longer than usual!"
"1014","3","My kids have fun with these, but they don't function how they're supposed to."
"1015","5","I'm so glad they can take a beating, good for ages 2-8 so far, lol"
"1016","5","like it"
"1017","3","They didn't work as well as I thought they would and the grandkids get frustrated with them."
"1018","3","They work like they're supposed to as far as the function goes but they don't stick to the bathtub wall or even the tub itself."
"1019","3","the cool spinners inside the tubes really never worked."
"1020","5","This is such a fun toy, especially for a little bit older kids.  I bought this for my 2 year old, but I think my 6 year old enjoys it most :)"
"1021","4","Suction cups aren't the best, but these are fun for our two year old."
"1022","4","Unfortunately these do not work on tile that has any texture. Otherwise, good quality and my toddler really likes them."
"1023","5","Papa Noel, aka Santa, brought these and they've been a huge hit! Super fun and given the suction cup back and swivel end caps your child can be quite inventive with pipe ""courses"" and set up."
"1024","5","Great Product!"
"1025","2","The suction cups didn't stick to the bathtub very well."
"1026","5","I got these (along with the Boon Cogs Water Gears) for my 20 month old and he's loves playing with them in the tub or on our front glass door.  It works great individually or together!  I can see his little mind working trying to figure it out when he splashes water on them.  Love, love, love!"
"1027","5","so very fun"
"1028","5","These are really cute and my daughter loves playing with them! I love the bright colors and different function of each. The white pipe has a different spiral than is pictured, which doesn't often spin. The water just comes out around the spinner. However, still really cute."
"1029","5","They are a great size that both of our kids can play together. It helps when washing their hair."
"1030","3","This bath toy is just okay.  All of the pieces don't really work well together and the suction is not good at all."
"1031","5","My 1 year old twins get bored with toys after a while but they absolutely love these!"
"1032","5","Love this shower toys. Bought it for a 3 year old boy and he loved them. He keep himself entertain playing for long time with out splashing all over the bathroom. His 5 year old sister love them too. I going to order and other box just former."
"1033","5","Love these for bath time.  My 3 year old loves them... sometimes I play with them too"
"1034","5","These are great for bath time at Grandma's. Stick to the tub. Each pipe is a little different than the other. Great learning tools"
"1035","5","My kids love them."
"1036","5","Had this for 3 months and my 5 yo (bought for) and my 11 yo daughters both use these still."
"1037","3","One of the pipes did not turn when you pour the water in.  They are fun to watch and really suction tight to the side of the tub."
"1038","5","Gave this as a gift for a one year old.  Was told she loves it and plays with it  all the time."
"1039","5","My toddler loves these little bath toys...they keep her entertained and have held up very well!"
"1040","5","Bought these for our two year old nephew as a birthday gift and he LOVES them.  Great idea for not so common toys."
"1041","5","Daughter loves these at our local discovery museum and now having them at home for bath time she has just as much fun"
"1042","5","These are really fun for my two toddler boys.  I even enjoy configuring them to try and keep the water going.  A favorite for all at bath time."
"1043","5","These were a great toy for the tub!"
"1044","3","Fun for our 2 year old grandson but they don't stick to the tile wall. I have cleaned the wall with alcohol and everything else but eventually they fall off."
"1045","5","3 and 4 year old love playing with these in the bath.  Excellent toy, good price."
"1046","5","Both my 5 and 7 year old are enjoying this. They love to try different combinations to get the water flowing."
"1047","5","I think I have more fun with these than my son.  They are cute, a little overpriced in my opinion, but a different sort of bath toy!"
"1048","5","My boys love to play with these in the bath tub!! Sturdy and well made too."
"1049","4","These work fine and are just as advertized. Would recommend."
"1050","3","These are fun but they do tend to fall off the easily."
"1051","2","it does not stick on ""mesh"" tiles. our tiles are 1x2"" and these dont stick. it's ok.would not recommend."
"1052","5","Our 16 month old loves these bath tubes. Lots of fun!"
"1053","5","We love bath time around here so this was a great addition for my almost 3-year-old. My now, almost 10-month-old also loves to spin the wheels and play while his brother pours the water! Wins all around!"
"1054","5","Great tub toy!"
"1055","3","There was so many 5 star reviews... my best us played with it 10 mins and never again. Not fun :("
"1056","3","My kiddo loves to play with these and is fascinated by them. Beware, though: They will NOT suction to your walls if your tile is painted. :("
"1057","5","Really cool toy, I'm considering buying more because they are so much fun"
"1058","4","My two year old really gets a kick out of these.  I wish: I had more of them and I could connect them together.  The T-shaped one is kind of useless."
"1059","5","Easy to use, and at the risk of being cliche, makes bath-time fun for my little kids! The suction cups, always the bane of other bath products, work pretty well."
"1060","5","My niece and daughter love these! Sticks perfectly"
"1061","5","My 4 year old loves these! Great for imaginative water play."
"1062","5","The kids love using these.  They also don't seem to trap water in them anywhere so no worries about them getting moldy."
"1063","4","I like that they are larger and seem to be of good quality."
"1064","5","My 9 month old son loves these. He doesn't quite get the concept yet but loves that they have spinning parts."
"1065","4","The toys shipped fast and are making my child want to take baths. The only issue I have is that the blue tube came with a warped suction cup, making it unable to stick to the bathtub wall like it's compadres. <U+0001F614>"
"1066","5","Super cute toy. Stick great to our soaker tub walls."
"1067","1","Suction cups don't hold suction. We tried on multiple surfaces and even tried silicone to semi-permanently stick them, but nothing worked."
"1068","4","my toddler loves these in the bathtub, so I bought them for my nephews too! They don't stick very well but overall, pretty great bathtub toy!"
"1069","5","Awesome bath toys"
"1070","4","Grandkids enjoy these."
"1071","5","Kids love these!"
"1072","5","My 20 month old loves these and so does my 5 year old!  Win win during bath time together!!!"
"1073","5","I wish there was one cup or such."
"1074","5","This is one of the best bath toys out there!"
"1075","5","Massive hit with the kids! Makes bathtime fun!"
"1076","5","My triplets enjoy them! Keeps them entertained while bathing."
"1077","5","MY SON LOVES THESE"
"1078","5","Grand kids loved these.  Held to side of tub but were easy to remove.  Fun & educational.  Highly recommend."
"1079","4","My 19 month old son likes these. But he isn't obsessed over them hence 4 stars instead of 5. Maybe when he is older, he'll figure out how to use them creatively to get water to go from one to the next etc."
"1080","4","Provides tons of fun in the bath"
"1081","5","My kids (3 year old twins) LOVE playing with these in the bath!"
"1082","4","Great product. My kids love constructing a series of pipes and dumping water through them."
"1083","3","Some of the suction cups don't work. :( Which is a shame because they're really fun and my daughter loves them --  just frustrating that they keep falling off!"
"1084","5","Our son loves these! Great fine motor activity for the tub."
"1085","5","By far our child's favorite bath toy."
"1086","3","My kid likes it and it entertains my husband's engineering brain when he helps with bath time."
"1087","2","Some of the suction cups don't work. Bummer."
"1088","3","Loved the idea but they don't stick well to the tub."
"1089","5","my 2 yr old daughter thinks they are great, she loves toys"
"1090","3","Smaller than expected.  It is a gift so I hoped it would be larger."
"1091","1","Waste of money. They fall off the wall and they aren't entertaining."
"1092","2","After removing to clean I can no longer get all of these to stick to the wall... Disappointing"
"1093","3","Not too interesting.... water doesn't come out as quickly or efficiently as I thought. Suction isn't as good either."
"1094","1","Did not work at all had to drill the holes bigger"
"1095","2","Disappointed..these do not stick to my bathroom tile. They stick on the bath tub, but then they are too low to be able to make them into fun designs."
"1096","5","All my kids love these!"
"1097","5","Fun for all and an EASY gift for other kiddos too!Our kiddo loves the motion and water play, a great lesson in cause and effect even at this age."
"1098","5","Great gift for any toddler!"
"1099","5","My grandson doesn't want to get out of the bath since we gave him this toy set!"
"1100","3","These are cool, but they don't do a good job sticking to the bath tub and walls."
"1101","5","My 18 month old son is obsessed with these!"
"1102","5","Kids love them."
"1103","5","My 2 year old granddaughter has a knack for engineering, so I bought this to nurture this.  She loves it.  She played with it so long in the tub, she got scared at her water wrinkles."
"1104","5","My 10, 7, and 1 year old all love these!"
"1105","5","I bought these for my daughter. She loves pouring water into them every night during her bath. Great toy."
"1106","5","my two year old loves these and they are fun for mom to play with in the tub too.  enjoyed."
"1107","5","Very cool bath time"
"1108","5","I bought this for my grandkids I absolutely love. They play with it every time they take a bath."
"1109","5","These make bath time so fun! And a different bath toy to keep the kids attention and help them enjoy bath time."
"1110","5","So much fun!"
"1111","5","Daughter loves these for bath time.  Thank you!"
"1112","5","A lot of fun! Makes kids want to take a bath and not get get out!"
"1113","5","My 3-year-old son loves pouring water into these pipes and watching it come through.  He also likes to pretend they're cups or instruments."
"1114","5","These are great and unique fun! Both my boys love them and they are 5 years apart (5 and 10)."
"1115","5","Yes, great tub toy for young or old."
"1116","5","My two boys love these. They can change them around and they can do it themselves."
"1117","5","my 18 month old loves these!"
"1118","3","These work okay. Seem to come off our wall pretty easy. But the little one loves them!!"
"1119","5","My little guy loves these! Awesome bath toy!"
"1120","3","Does not work so good"
"1121","5","Best bath toy on the market for any age."
"1122","3","These fall off and some that are supposed to spin or pour water, don't."
"1123","3","I wish they were able to connect with each other but they don't."
"1124","5","Great grandson loves playing with them"
"1125","5","A mi hijo el encantan"
"1126","5","I bought these for my son who is 23 months and wanted to find something that would entertain him in the tub so he would want to be in there longer and I struck gold! These are super fun and very interactive. My son loves them and so do I:-)"
"1127","5","My boys absolutely love this product! Arrive on time and intact. The pipes are about 6in so they work great in the bath tub"
"1128","5","Lots of fun in & out of the bath,"
"1129","2","They don't stick to the tub which is why the review is 2 stars.  Really disappointed in these because I thought my daughter would love them but they fall all the time and she doesn't really get to play with them like I thought she would."
"1130","5","Our special needs grandson has lots of fun with these in the tub and so do his siblings."
"1131","5","Kids love this - age 3 and up really enjoy it"
"1132","3","My 3 year old loves them but one of them does not have suction to stay to the tub wall so it's just a tube she can't hang it"
"1133","5","My baby boy is loving these - and now that he can actually has the aim to get water into them he spends a lot of time in the tub!"
"1134","5","My kids LOVE these! They stick really well and I am happy to have a bath tot that does t need to be thrown away after 2 weeks."
"1135","5","One of the funnest bath toys we have!"
"1136","5","Just what I thought it would be."
"1137","4","Works fine."
"1138","5","My grandson plays with these every time he visits. Great water play toys- I highly recommend them for toddlers.  I also bought a set for a friend's grandchildren who also enjoy them."
"1139","5","My kids loved it. So entertaining during bathtime."
"1140","5","My sons loves these and so did my fiance lol. These are super cute and worth the price!"
"1141","4","great for the 4 year old"
"1142","5","Cute"
"1143","4","Kids like them"
"1144","5","Great bathtime fun! My toddler loves them!"
"1145","5","My 3-year-old toddler enjoys playing with it a lot."
"1146","4","These are great fun in the tub. They stick to the walls of the tub ok, but do come off with little effort. Love the wheels that spin and stacking them to funnel through to one another. For my 21 month old."
"1147","2","These don<U+2019>t really work how you would expect them to.  They always fall off the wall.  The kids seem to be entertained by them tho."
"1148","5","Great if used gently, my 3 grandsons are a tad on the rough side...., they enjoyed them"
"1149","3","one of the pipes faces wrong and the wheel doesn't turn"
"1150","5","I bought these for my little girls and they love them!"
"1151","5","My 3 year old loves these and we set them up on the side of the bath tub during his baby brother's (10 weeks) bath time, too, so that he can ""be involved"" in that time without getting in the way. He looks forward to bath time so he can play with these! Great simple toy!"
"1152","5","PRO:Who hates tub toys!Fun movements3 year old approvedCON:None!"
"1153","5","These little bath toys are so cute and work well.  Will be buying gears next to add to this set."
"1154","5","Grandchildren were very interested in the way this set worked. Good little ""happy"". Pokeypoo"
"1155","5","Our Toddler absolutely LOVES these - and so do we! Water doesn't get stuck in them (like squirt toys) and he can configure them in so many different ways. So happy with this purchase!"
"1156","5","Fun"
"1157","5","These are really cool. My 1 year old loves watching the fan spin. Not a big hit with the 3 year old."
"1158","4","They're fun to play with, but don't stick great on the shower or tub wall.  My 2 yr old enjoys playing with them."
"1159","5","Super fun bath toy!!"
"1160","5","Fabulous!"
"1161","5","Great for imagination and a little more bath time. Hang to dry, avoid the mold as best you can."
"1162","4","work as expected, really tedious getting them possitioned correctly though!"
"1163","4","The tubes don't stick perfectly if the wall is not smooth, but they will stick temporarily.  They are still lots of fun."
"1164","5","Perfect gift for any preschool age or toddler. Absolutely LOVE!"
"1165","5","My grandsons love!"
"1166","5","My 2 year old loves playing with his new toys in the shower!  Thank you!"
"1167","5","Our two toddlers love these"
"1168","5","These are really neat and easy to use. My boys, 2 and 3, lost interest after a few bath sessions."
"1169","5","My 3 and 7 year old boys are OBSESSED with these. Best gift ever!"
"1170","5","My daughter loves plying with these. She sticks them on the wall or the side of the tub and pours water, making different paths every time."
"1171","3","They work...mostly. He<U+2019>s entertained."
"1172","5","Kids loved it."
"1173","5","My daughter loves bath time and we are always looking for fun new activities. The pipes are very sturdy and stay on the wall of the bath tub even with her moving them. I would recommend this purchase to all the parents out there!"
"1174","5","Great fun in the bath"
"1175","5","Fun toy for the kids.  This is the way to create budding engineers!"
"1176","3","One of the spinners immediately stopped working. For the premium price, I expect a bulletproof toy. Otherwise, the kiddo spends a lot of time playing with them."
"1177","3","Pricey; not worth it."
"1178","5","Super fun.  Kids love them, they stick well to the tub, even after 6 months."
"1179","4","Kids seem to like them while in the bath."
"1180","5","My kids love these!"
"1181","5","My kids love them and so far I havent had a problem with them sticking to the tub"
"1182","5","Great gift. Grand babies love them."
"1183","5","By far, this is the best bath toy ever! We've tried everything from the ones that stack to the ones that spin, paddle, stick or squirt. And these are the only ones that keep our 16 month old entertained. They're even fun for me during bath time. Instead of sticking them on the wall, we have them floating in the tub. Our daughter scoops the water up with the pipes, and watches the stream come out. I'm sure these toys will grow with her and she will use them to connect on the wall.Our daughter used to be a huge water baby, but she slipped in the tub, and choked on water. After that she no longer wanted to sit in the tub, and would only stand up. This bath toy along with swim class really helped her become a water baby again. She loves these, and I do too!"
"1184","3","It's ok. If I had to do it over again I wouldn't buy it my son doesn't really use it and it doesn't really stick to the tub."
"1185","5","My grandsons favorite bath toy?"
"1186","4","These are fun for the bath but they don't stick that well and fall often."
"1187","5","these are so fun in the tub"
"1188","4","Lots of fun, kids enjoy them a lot"
"1189","5","Really fun bath play. Endless configurations."
"1190","4","Underwhelming, but keeps my kids busy in the tub!"
"1191","5","Great toy for young kids, good way to distract them."
"1192","2","Don't stick well."
"1193","5","My granddaughter will have fun"
"1194","5","Fun bath toy!"
"1195","5","my almost 2 year old LOVES these!"
"1196","3","Most of the suction cups on these do not stick to our bathtub consistently.  Also, some of the spinning/twirling features do not work at all, the water just flows through without causing any motion.  My kids (3.5 and 6.5) really enjoy playing with them in the tub, though, so they're okay."
"1197","5","Everyone loves these! For the bath, water table, or pool!"
"1198","5","My son loves playing with these pipes in the bath. They're perfect for his age!  Was worried that they wouldn't stick to the tub but I haven't Had any issues."
"1199","5","Love this bathtub pipes too cute"
"1200","5","Product was as described."
"1201","5","I bought these for my grandson and he LOVES THEM! I originally purchased them for a water table but they suction to a wall. So now they are his favorite bath toy. They stick well to the wall, are small enough for him to hold and pretty colors. The different water streams are very therapeutic too."
"1202","2","Kids love them but they don<U+2019>t stick well"
"1203","5","My 2.5 year olds love these! The colors are great and the suction cups hold up to twins tugging on them. Keeps them busy during bath time"
"1204","5","The kids love it! one caveat: at least while new, it sticks so hard to the bath that it's pretty hard for toddlers to move around, and requires a parent's help"
"1205","5","Best water toy ever, very engaging. My 2 and 5 y/o boys play wth it every day for the last 6 month and still love it!"
"1206","4","Not sure why it took so long to come across this bath toy set because I had been looking for something like this over the past year and a half, and we love Boon products.In any case, we purchased this set and it's really fun for our girls to play with while they're in the bath.  The set functions exactly as you can imagine.  The only slight drawback is that the water does not come out of the tubes with a consistent arc.  What I mean by that is if the water exits the tube at an angle (like the pink and green tubes), the water will come out with a different arc depending on how much water there is in the tube.  The water pressure changes how forceful the water exits.  not a big deal, but if you wanted to set up all the pieces in a sequential setup, it can be difficult because of the variability of the water flow"
"1207","5","Nice toy for the bath"
"1208","5","These stick really well to the tub."
"1209","4","These are great! My grandson loves them."
"1210","5","My 5-year old autistic grandson loves these!  I can't imagine any child close to this age group not enjoying these bath pipes."
"1211","5","Super cute"
"1212","3","They are ok. My child plays with then occasionally, but wasn't overly wowed by them. Overall, and average buy"
"1213","5","These are fun bath toys. The top has a funnel so all the water when poured doesn't rush right out."
"1214","5","At first it was hard for the suckshion cups to stick to out tile wall but after the first use they stuck firmly.. Now all day my 2 year old begs for tubby time to play with these bath toys"
"1215","5","Gift"
"1216","5","This is a great bath toy!"
"1217","5","makes bath time fun"
"1218","5","These are great! We have gotten a lot of use of if these. 3 year old grandson loves  them."
"1219","5","My 6 yo son has enjoyed playing with them."
"1220","4","Grand kids love them!"
"1221","4","My kids love these for bath time!"
"1222","4","Great set! Only thing missing is a cup/pitcher for pouring water into the tubes."
"1223","5","Totally met expectations. It's fluid dynamics for toddlers and our daughter enjoys them. That said, they do look like the Marquis de Sade tried to design a breast pump."
"1224","5","This water pipes set is so cool. My kiddo loves these pipes. Great bath time experience."
"1225","5","love it! my grandkids enjoyed it very much!  ill buy again!"
"1226","5","This is our new favorite bath toy! Holds the interest and attention of my 2.5 year old."

"1231","2","Some of our pipes didn't work. Good at sticking to the wall."
"1232","2","Very small. Not what I thought it would be."
"1233","5","Very pleased! Our 17-month year old boy is engaged and keeping the water in the tub now. (:"
"1234","5","I have bought three sets for my grandchildren and they are a big hit!"
"1235","3","we have had this for a bit now, and i really wanna love it. But we have one that's green, but its the blue one in the product photo it doesn't spin at all just water falls to the bottom with no effect. Than the coolest one is the white and yellow one in the product photo but it holds such a small amount of water so my son tends to get bored with it currently because he wants a constant flow. im sure it will be more of a hit when he does the filling himself and can a-line them to flow like pipes."
"1236","5","Excellent play set! Surprisingly well made."
"1237","5","Creating little engineers in the bathtub. The kids cant get enough!!! Ages 1,6, and 12"
"1238","5","My 2yo son is obsessed with these!! Great cause and effect. Very high quality. They are a part of every bath time!"
"1239","4","The kids love them."
"1240","4","Looks like packaging has been open"

"1246","5","My toddler was fighting bath time so we thought we would give these a try and guess what he loves bath time again!"
"1247","5","My 4 year grandson loves it.  Easy to use, clean, and store."
"1248","2","great concept but disappointed that we have had them less than 2 weeks and the suction cups are failing on all but one.  Spend your money on something else."
"1249","5","My 2 yo twins love these and the gears."
"1250","5","Great bath tub toys. My 2 year old and 10 month old love playing/pouring water into the tubes."
"1251","2","Don't work that great and grandkids really don't like them."
"1252","3","Suction cups don't work on our tile, but they do fine on the glass door."
"1253","5","My kids love these!!"
"1254","5","Sooooo fun! I play with them more than my kids!"
"1255","5","My grandchildren enjoy this a lot"
"1256","5","Kids love these....great extra to have in the bath."
"1257","3","Cute bath toy. Great concept for problem solving and figuring out motor functions. The main issue is it doesn't stay on the tub/wall very well."
"1258","5","Really love them. Just be careful, depends on your walls, they dont stick in mine."
"1259","5","My daughter loves these! She has so much fun trying out new combinations every night and has yet to grow bored with them. These are high quality and I expect that they will last a long time."
"1260","4","My 2 year old nephew loves playing with these in the tub."
"1261","5","Bought these 2 years ago and my nephew still plays with them in the bath."
"1262","3","Really fun but the suction cups are horrible. Barley stay on."
"1263","5","My 2 year old LOVES playing with these."
"1264","5","Kids love these!"
"1265","5","Grandkids love em"
"1266","4","Overall great fun but a little tricky for my little one to line them up. I would still buy them as he has an obsession with these water pipes."
"1267","5","Best bath toy ever! Has made bathtime enjoyable for my toddler."
"1268","4","Our 2 1/2 yr old loves these! BUT the white pipe does not work ( the gear is not put in correctly so it does not spin )  .... hoping for a response to help us replace it! Thank you!!"
"1269","5","This is such a neat idea.  My kids love pouring the water in and watching the effects.  They suction to the wall very well and the colors are fun and bright."
"1270","5","Awesome toys."
"1271","5","My kid loves this. It really makes his bath time fun!"
"1272","4","These are cool, my two yr old girl loves them and they stick great!"
"1273","5","My granddaughter loves playing with these boon water pipes.  Very entertaining for her."
"1274","3","My grandson enjoys playing with these."
"1275","2","These aren<U+2019>t as much fun as we were hoping. The water flow is too slow for age 3. Maybe younger would like more."
"1276","5","Love the colors and the tubes."
"1277","5","Fun for child and parents too."
"1278","2","Doesn't stick to the bath walls well, so it is difficult for the kids to actually make any patters that work together."
"1279","5","My son loves to play with these, they are a great sensory bath toy!"
"1280","2","Doesn't get a tight fit unless your walls are completely smooth."
"1281","5","Perfect for little one!"
"1282","5","best bath toy purchase i've made in a while kids love love love it.  Thank goodness cuz it sure did cost enough"
"1283","5","Best bath toy ever!! I bought for the baby but my 6 year old has taken over and I can't get her out of the bath!!"
"1284","5","Tons of fun! My son loves these"
"1285","5","These are super neat. My son is still a little young and just tries to drink out of them, but my husband and I have been enjoying them ha!"
"1286","5","I bought these for my nephew when he was 1 and a half and my sister in law said he liked them so I'd say they're a great bath toy for your little ones."
"1287","1","These do not stay attached well to our tile tub/shower."
"1288","5","My toddler boy was very entertained by these. Other bath toys did not interest him as much or as long as these!"
"1289","5","Best bath toy for my children! Love that I dont have to worry about mold."
"1290","5","Love love love boon products!"
"1291","5","My toddler loves these!! He plays for a long time in tub with these"
"1292","2","Pretty cool but don't stick on the walls very well"
"1293","2","Some pipes are impossible to attach to the tub wall because of where the suction cups are located."
"1294","4","Sticks well to walls, kid loves them. Only complaint is that doesn't hold much water, need to constantly refill, especially the water wheels. Minor complaint. Kid LOVES these things"
"1295","3","Underwhelming. But the kids still play with them. More as trumpets instead of water toys though."
"1296","4","One of the spinners doesn't spin. But so far son had fun with them on flagship bath"
"1297","5","My grandkids love playing with these in the bathtub."
"1298","5","Love these! I got some for my daughter a few months ago (she's almost 3) and have just ordered a set for my niece's Christmas present. They both love bath time and will enjoy these for a long time."
"1299","5","Kids like this"
"1300","5","The stepchildren loved it (ages 3 and 7 -- boys). The oldest one takes his bath alone and had a hard time with the suction cups, but with adult help, they were actually pretty fun!"
"1301","5","Sticks to tub great. My 2 year old loves playing with them!"
"1302","5","Super cute and hours of fun, but if you don't have real tile in your shower or tub they WILL NOT stick to it :("
"1303","2","Very cool idea and appealing to the eye, but they just don't work well. The suction cups do not hold the tubes up for the entire bath leading to a very frustrated 4 year old!  Really wanted these to work."
"1304","5","grand kids love them."
"1305","5","More fun spend time in bath for son"
"1306","5","The kids like them and the function well."
"1307","2","A couple of the pipes don't stick to the wall longer than a minute, so my LO ends up using it to pour."
"1308","5","My girls love playing with these! The suction is almost too good, it pulls on my cheap bathroom walls when tubby time is over and we put away the toys. Good toy unless you have flimsy walls."
"1309","5","My 3 year old and 10 months old both love playing with this during their bath time."
"1310","5","Baby enjoyed the toy, and the parents loved playing with the baby and the toys."
"1311","5","Can't hardly get kids out of tub. Hard to find good bathtub toys but this is it!"
"1312","5","18 month old loves them.  Keeps him busy in the tub"
"1313","3","Nothing angers me as much as a child's toy that hasn't been tested properly.  This is the second toy I've bought from Amazon that doesn't come up to expectations.My great-grandson loves to play in the tub.  These pipes are exactly the type of toy he likes.  However, they do not stick to the wall.  The T shaped one is too heavy for its sucker.  The two straight ones stick for a couple of seconds and then 'pop' off they go falling into the tub.Fortunately for him, he has a broad imagination and is having fun with them in other ways.  His grandmother and I are both disappointed.  And I hate seeing him upset because his toy doesn't work as it should."
"1314","5","So fun! Even my 9 mo old gets a kick out of them. Lining them up so the water flows to other pipes is tricky but doable and so gratifying when it works. Be sure to take them down when ur done...they tend to fall when they start to dry and scare the you know what out of you."
"1315","4","Doesn't stick to ceramic tile."
"1316","5","Grandson loves these and so does mom!"
"1317","5","Great for bathtime."
"1318","5","LOVE these! I had these in my cart for awhile, waiting a good sale time to purchase. Happy I bit the bullet and got these! My older kids, 5 and 7, enjoy these and also the original intended item playee, the baby. We like to see the results of each tube with how it disposes of the water. The colors are vibrant! You can mix and match different ways for the water to fall and fill up another tube, or just to watch each way the tube disposes of the water. Either a straight empty, spinning a little spinner, two exits, dribbles, multiple holes, etc. It is fun to get creative with different set ups. They have so far stuck to our tile wall very well!"
"1319","4","This are fun"
"1320","4","My toddler really loves plying with these. They are a great idea for a bath toy. I wish I had this when I was a kid!Sadly, my son gets bored with every toy on earth and now they take up space in the bathroom. I still play with them from time to time. I had learned the best toys for the bathtub are from the kitchen. The weirder the tool the better. My son never gets tired of the potato masher.Most of these tubes are super easy to clean. I would feel better about mold if I could figure out how to remove the plastic cap ends on a couple of them. The pink one is the most difficult to clean out.  I've had them for months with no signs of mold. Just be sure to throw out rubber duckies as soon as you see discoloration on the inside... Also pay attention to the smell.These are truly a genius idea... I just wish my son could realize that for more than a month lol"
"1321","4","This is a fun toy."
"1322","5","These are great! It is helping the little one learn about physics and the way liquids behave; and kiddo has fun in the bath."
"1323","3","These will stick on the tub itself but not above it. The surface has to be completely smooth."
"1324","5","Great gift for boy or girl."
"1325","3","Wouldn't stick to tub, suction cups went flat,  hard to clean."
"1326","3","What an awesome idea -- great bath time toys, except this will not stick to anything but a perfectly smooth surface.  Unless you have super smooth tile or glass in the bath, this will not stick.  Kids still have fun though."
"1327","5","Great tub toy"
"1328","3","Great interactive water toy...when it sticks to the tile. The plastic ring is quite flimsy and doesn't attach well to the bath tile. It keeps falling, which frustrates the little one."
"1329","2","Great concept but will not stick to the tile or the bathtub maybe I just got unlucky and receive a damaged product."
"1330","5","Great quality product. From the pictures it looked a bit cheap but the product is actually nice and durable."
"1331","4","Would be 5 stars, but one piece doesn't twirl unless a lot of water pours in, so it can't easily integrate with the other pieces."
"1332","5","my son loves these!!! they stick well to the bathroom wall, they dont get moldy or gross he absolutely loves them and it reduces the splashing he was making OUT of the tub!"
"1333","5","Kids love it, they actually fight to use them, I should order another set. But I'd like to find something similar but different shapes and functionality."
"1334","5","My two year old loves these. He would sit and play with these in the bathtub for hours if we let him. Definitely one of the best bath toys I've ever bought. Well worth the money."
"1335","5","Kids love bath time fun."
"1336","2","Disappointing. Some of the spinners don<U+2019>t rotate when water flows through."
"1337","2","one of the pipes arrived cracked."
"1338","5","Super fun my kids love them"
"1339","5","3 yr old grandson loves these tubes. Makes bath time really really fun!"
"1340","5","My son loves these"
"1341","5","My 1,5 years old nephew likes it a lot"
"1342","5","Just when bath time was starting to get boring, we discovered these water pipes. My 20 month old loves throwing them in the tub while we fill it up and then plays the whole time with them and has for the past month or so. He loves pouring water from one pipe to another, sticking them on the wall or side of the tub and throwing them. Great toy! Wish they would screw together to make one lone pipe though but that's just wishful thinking. ;)"
"1343","5","My daughter is only 15 months old, and when she saw these, she got so excited.  She even crawled into the shower (with it going) completely clothed so she could start playing with these.  I love that these are not only fun, but will keep her stimulated and can be combined with her other bath time toys.  I would highly recommend this set for anyone with kids.  I am considering purchasing another set to go with this, or the gears to add on at some point."
"1344","5","Kids love these!"
"1345","5","Great idea for tub toys!"
"1346","5","18 month loves these. They are very fun at bath time."
"1347","5","So funny. Ideal for the bath. Much better than any thing else"
"1348","5","the kids loved them."
"1349","5","Our kids (three two and under) love playing with these- and I love that they are easy to clean and stick to the side of the tub."
"1350","4","Nice bright colors!  Our little one is a water baby and absolutly loves anything he can use in the tub!I wish they were a bit larger as he has a hard time pouring water into them but we're working on it!"
"1351","5","My grandsons absolutely love this product. I also got the gears and they may different designs and enjoy pouring the water in different ways."
"1352","4","Fun way to get kids to stay in the tub a bit longer!"
"1353","5","Hours of entertainment in the shower!!!! All my three children age 2, 4, and 5 like it!!!!"
"1354","5","Child loved them, great price"
"1355","5","My kids love it"
"1356","1","VERY misleading. 10 bucks for ONE tiny figure is  assanine!"
"1357","5","This is perhaps the best purchase that we have made for our little ones. They really enjoy playing with them, especially our 1 year old boy. All but 1 functions exactly how they are supposed to, but even at that, the kids enjoy them.I think that all kids would get joy out of these. Having said that, I would recommend this product to anyone with kids under the age of 5, although older kids 8 and younger may enjoy them, I think their play with it would be much shorter term.It seems safe for toddlers and babies because there doesn't appear to be any little pieces which was a relief to me."
"1358","3","Suction cups were bent so they do not stay suctioned to the tub. Otherwise a cool idea for a toy"
"1359","5","My 4yo loves these."
"1360","5","These are great for my four year old. We use them on the patio glass doors in the summer. I ordered 2 sets so he can build all kinds of things!"
"1361","4","1.5 year old loves them, but they don't stick to the tile in our bathroom, just the tub. Limits the usability a little. Other than that, they are great. Also gave them as a gift, and heard good things."
"1362","5","These are the best bath toy we own. My kids love them so much we've actually bought a second set. The only problem is that they seem to be widely sold out and hard to find now!"
"1363","3","Cant keep it stuck to the wall."
"1364","5","Neat Tub Toys"
"1365","5","Bought one for us and repurchased as gifts"
"1366","5","My kid loves these."
"1367","5","The kids love these (ages 2 and 4)!  Was able to get them into the bathtub with so much excitement!"
"1368","5","My son love them. very good for creativity"
"1369","5","My kid loves playing with the tubes in the tub!"
"1370","4","Bought it for my toddler and the whole family loves them!!!"
"1371","5","Love these for our tub"
"1372","5","baby loves them"
"1373","5","This is now my son's favorite bath toy. My son is 3 yrs old. It took so long to get him out of the tub the day this arrived in the mail. Not only did he want to take a bath (like stripped down and climbed in the tub  <mostly> by himself but we had to literally pull him from the tub. We have a bunch of cups (with holes on the bottom) that my son likes to play with in the tub, so I figured this would be a good addition. He had so much fun sticking these to the walls and the walls of the tub. He would put different tubes underneath other tubes. These stick pretty good and he couldn't always get them off on his own. We've only had these for a couple days but I had to come on here and write this review. It's such a simple idea that is quite a bit of fun in the tub that doesn't take up much space."
"1374","5","Kids love this"
"1375","4","Great bath toys! But the box came taped together and really beat up."
"1376","4","Lots of fun. Stick well.  Wish you could actually connect a couple."
"1377","5","kids like"
"1378","5","So so cute and perfect for my son to play in the bathtub!"
"1379","5","Kids love them!"
"1380","5","Our little girl loves these! They actually stay in place when you pour water in!"
"1381","5","Fun to play with."
"1382","5","Our kids are 3 and 1 and both love these pipes"
"1383","5","physics based water game. Awesome."
"1384","5","The perfect bath toy for our 3 year old."
"1385","3","Pipes aren't long enough to get a good flow going, and the water mostly just trickles out, nothing too entertaining. My two year old enjoys them enough though."
"1386","5","Kids love it.  What fun"
"1387","4","Kids love these"
"1388","5","These water pipes saved bath time! My 10 month old would continuously gravitate towards the tub faucet which involved her standing unsteadily and me repeatedly wrestling her back to a safe sitting position which she didn't like one bit (and neither did I). 1.5 months later with these and she doesn't go for the faucet anymore and I don't have to wrestle her, which makes bath time fun again for both of us. She gets excited every time I'm setting up for bath time and it takes a lot less energy from me to get her clean and keep her entertained. This was a great $9 investment to our sanity (and safety!)"
"1389","5","Great bath time toy. Very entertaining to my kids."
"1390","3","My child likes them, but they do not stick to the walls/tub very well"
"1391","5","These are awesome my 2 and 4 year old love them"
"1392","5","These are awesome!  Best bath time toys I've gotten for my kids so far."
"1393","5","Kids are amused"
"1394","5","Fun bath toys"
"1395","5","fun for bath time. the ones that spin far outshine the others in terms of interest, but overall great bath toys."
"1396","5","My son loves them!"
"1397","5","Super fun bath toy. My  son has loved these from 16 months on"
"1398","5","The 2 1/2-year-old loves these pieces.  They stick to the tile really well and release pretty easily.  Several interesting activities in the tubes, too."
"1399","4","My 2 year old son love these things. They are a great product for the tub. Good teaching tool too."
"1400","5","As advertised"
"1401","5","I was very pleased with the product, my granddaughter loves them!"
"1402","3","Wish they stuck better, wish they worked better when connected with each other. Still this is a fun toy and our kids love them."
"1403","5","So far my son has really enjoyed these. He is 3 years old . Usually bath time is dreaded for him and now he's been asking everyday to get a bath so he can play with these ."
"1404","5","Great bath toy for my 2 year old.  He loves watching water go down the different tubes."
"1405","2","Falls off constantly with in 5 min of placing."
"1406","4","They make bath time more fun. And kids can use their imagination to create different water routes."
"1407","5","Great item. They are played with every time my little guy takes a bath."
"1408","5","Great!"
"1409","5","PERFECT"
"1410","5","Super toy for my granddaughter (2yrs).  Can be configured many ways."
"1411","3","One of the suction cups doesn't work."
"1412","5","my 13 month old son loves it."
"1413","5","Cool bath toys!!!"
"1414","5","My 2 and 5 year olds love these! Lots of fun!"
"1415","5","These are really great quality and were the perfect size.  They stuck right to the wall and the side of the tub very easily.  My 18 month old absolutely loved them.  They stick really well, but have a well designed tab that makes it easy to unstick them when you want to. We got the 5 tubes pictured and they were quite fascinating even for me.  I could easily see this still being entertaining for an older child as well.  The white and blue tubes with the wheel and spinner are easily the best of the tubes though.  It was all I could do to get my little girl out of the tub when she first played with these.  I would definitely recommend these and actually plan to buy a set for my niece and nephew for their birthday too!"
"1416","2","Easily fall off the shower wall."
"1417","5","Great quality"
"1418","5","Great"
"1419","3","Not all of the pipes spin when water goes through them."
"1420","5","Not your typical bath toy!  These are well made and packaged,  lots of fun!"
"1421","5","Could not get the kids out of the bathtub!! They LOVED it!"
"1422","5","These pipes are amazing, my 9 mo LOVES them, and so does mommy! The suction cups are fantastic quality, the moving parts twirl with ease. Well worth the money."
"1423","4","The suction cups don't stick to our shower walls very well; but my son still enjoys playing with them in the bath water."
"1424","5","These are so much fun the kids love it."
"1425","4","My Grandson loves this! My only disappointment is that my well water makes the plastic appear cloudy."
"1426","5","the kids love these for bath time"
"1427","5","Wonderful! My son loves it! It distracted him enough to where he finally has stopped throwing water on the floor. Great toy!"
"1428","5","My granddaughter loves to take a bath and play with these!"
"1429","5","My 4 year old loves it!!!"
"1430","3","Really like the toys. Great auction cups and fun to stack them together! Giving 3 stars because one of the spinning parts doesn't spin and is defective."
"1431","5","Kids have LOVED these"
"1432","5","Pretty cool but small"
"1433","5","My 3 year old loves this toy. Great auction and lots of fun for the tub"
"1434","5","Great bath toy. 2 1/2  year old loves playing with them. Suctions well to side of bath."
"1435","5","very good"
"1436","5","Great bath toy!"
"1437","5","These are great bath toys! I've never seen them in stores and I'm thinking this may be a go to present for other kids in the future."
"1438","5","For kids that like baths and pouring water/ playing with water... it kept my two toddlers (2 & 3) busy in the bathtub for an hour!"
"1439","1","Suction did not work"
"1440","5","Bought this along with the ""Bugs.""  My 1-1/2 year old granddaughter loves this, as well as her 4 year old sister.  (They are the best 'reviewers.')  It is a quality toy that allows their imagination to take the lead."
"1441","5","It makes the grandkids happy.  Downside, It is harder to get the grandkids out of the tub."
"1442","5","Both of my kids love this toy!"
"1443","5","Our nephew loves the toys. Received for his 2nd birthday. Will buy more"
"1444","1","Waste of money"
"1445","5","The kids love these.  They play with them every night."
"1446","5","Grankids"
"1447","1","Does not spin as it should"
"1448","3","One of the toys does not stick to the wall !!"
"1449","5","The kids love this! Use caution though, water goes farther than you expect! Lots of fun!"
"1450","5","Purchased these for my kids and they were so amazing that I went back and purchased another as a gift. Definitely recommend!"
"1451","5","Love these! Kids do too!!"
"1452","5","Grandkids love to play with these."

"1454","5","Work great"
"1455","5","Her favorite bath toy!"
"1456","5","My kids love these and play with them during every shower!"
"1457","2","The suction cups do not hold on three of the 5 pipes."
"1458","3","Sticking on the tub issues, but my almost 3 year old loves it."
"1459","3","Good product. But absolutly terrible shipping. My box was completly smashed and ripped. Was going to use as a bday gidt but now im unable to due to how bad the box was when it arrived."
"1460","4","My kids (3 and 1.5 year old) love them."
"1461","5","very good My boy like it . I bought two of them and he enjoyed it ."
"1462","2","Only 3/5 of the bath pipes had a functioning suction cup... so disappointing:("
"1463","5","My 2 year old absolutely loves this toy!  It is well made and works well with our tile shower."
"1464","5","My granddaughter loves theses! She is 3 yrs old."
"1465","3","Just okay."
"1466","4","My 2 1/2 year old son LOVES these pipes.  What a great idea."
"1467","5","My grandson loves playing with these."
"1468","4","Hours of fun for our two year old in the bath.  Some of them don't put out water as well but he will fill them over and over regardless."
"1469","5","Good for keeping kids busy in the tub"
"1470","5","My son loves them!"
"1471","4","Very fun. My daughter loves them. Have some trouble sticking to the bath, but other than that we love them."
"1472","5","best bath tub toy evey... highly recommend"
"1473","1","Great idea poorly executed. Moving parts poorly designed."
"1474","4","Engaging toy. Spiral toy needs to be refined, trouble rotating."
"1475","5","Hard to resist water play"
"1476","5","Enjoyed by our grandson and was great for pouring water."
"1477","5","These are very cool for the bath. My 5 year old enjoys building different paths for the water."
"1478","4","Great toys!!"
"1479","5","Fun new bath toy, my 4 and 6 yr olds love them!"
"1480","5","Gift for grandson. Looking forward to his playing with these"
"1481","3","Fun concept, but they don't stick very well, even on clean smooth subway tiles"
"1482","5","Our little girl loves these!"
"1483","1","The suction cups don't work well"
"1484","3","The white one doesn't spin. Looks to be a design flaw."
"1485","5","Great bath toy!"
"1486","5","These are a huge hit with our two-year old!"
"1487","3","These are cute and fun, but my kids have a hard time getting them to stick onto the bath walls."
"1488","5","This is hands down the best bath toy I've purchased! My 4 year old and 11 month old both love it, even after months of having it. It also has had the longest life of any bath toy we've had, managing to not be absolutely disgusting after months of use! Finally a bath toy that's not throwing money down the drain!"
"1489","5","fun, light, suction cups perfect for older kids to construct a workable maze"
"1490","4","I wanted to attach this to the tile in my bathroom but it will not suction. I only sticks to the tub but my son still LOVES it."
"1491","5","My son loves them. he could play for hours"
"1492","4","I like them more than my kid does, but they are cute, stay stuck on the wall mostly, and are a great alternative to a huge mess of random toys in the bottom of the tub.Some people in the other reviews complained about the turbine sticking. Mine sticks a little bit too. But, it doesn't bother any of us. The outlets of the tubes do stick into the inlets of the other tubes, but not super firmly.They could use a little more refinement in the manufacturing process. but you can thank walmart culture for lowering our modern standards of quality these days."
"1493","5","My 7 year old and 3 year old both love it!"
"1494","3","Can't stick on the wall very well"
"1495","5","Haven't used but the kids will love!"
"1496","5","SO fun! My son is just barely two and has a blast with these toys."
"1497","5","My 3.5 y/o son and his friend absolutely LOVED these pipes and the cogs, as well! We go them for vacation. They played for so long and didn't want to get out of the tub! I love the creativity it induces. I also LOVE the fact that you don't have to worry about mildew like the toys that suck water into them and can get left there. GREAT toys for a great price!"
"1498","5","Great fun in the tub!"
"1499","3","The white one doesn't spin when water is ran through it."
"1500","5","My kids love these."
"1501","5","My kids love these"
"1502","3","Received a used product, not cool for a gift."
"1503","2","Pretty disappointed in this actually.  When my wife bought it I thought cool, this would be awesome.  Not so.  The pipes don't hold enough water, so you're literally filling them up continuously.  Then... it's not very interesting or effective to try and get the pipes to pour sequentially into one another... finally, some of the spinner/water wheels don't work very well... generally speaking very disappointing.  My daughter lost interest after the second time we tried to use them, and only once in a blue moon shows interest in trying them anymore.  Would pass on this purchase... it's more imagination that's making you think it's worth buying-- the reality is ho hum."
"1504","4","it is a great demonstration of water movement but I wish that the tubes were longer to hold more water"
"1505","5","Loads of fun in the tub!!"
"1506","5","very fun for kids in the tub"
"1507","5","This is a quality product that works perfectly. My grand son really enjoys playing with this toy in Tre bath."
"1508","4","Kids are having a great time with these."
"1509","5","Lots of fun in the tub!"
"1510","4","Son loves it and is a must have at bath time now. Caution your child will spill more water on the floor."
"1511","5","Super fun toys! Stick well. Three year old daughter loves them."
"1512","5","Fun in the tub for grandson!"
"1513","1","These are cheap plastic pipes that don't work very well. I ended up returning them and of course Amazons amazing customer service refunded me."
"1514","5","Excellent bath toy. She loves putting them together."
"1515","5","Easy to keep clean"
"1516","5","Bought for my nephews and I hear they all fight over who gets to play with them at bath time!"
"1517","5","My kid loves these as does my inner kid"
"1518","5","Makes bathing easy! Son (2year old) can't get enough"
"1519","5","Bought for grandson and he loved it!"
"1520","5","Durable and great for water exploration.  My kids love them!"
"1521","5","my 4yr old daughter loves playing with these in bathtube"
"1522","5","Great product! Keeps him busy in the bathtub!"
"1523","5","I'm surprised how easy these stick and move on the shower wall. My 2-year-old love this."
"1524","3","Fun, but the straight tube with a spinning wheel doesn't work."
"1525","5","My son is 4 he got this for his birthday. He loves it!!! We have had no problems with it at all!! I would recommend it!!"
"1526","4","One of the pipes does not attach to the wall at all."
"1527","5","Awesome play toys for toddler."
"1528","5","Keeps our baby very engaged and happy!"
"1529","5","Grandkids  love this for bathtime!"
"1530","5","Love it! A lot of fun!"
"1531","1","I was so excited to buy these for my 3 year old. Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by this product. 1. The tubes aren't long enough for my toddler to enjoy the trickling effects of the water coming out. By the time he pours the water in, the water has already come out. 2. The suction on these is TERRIBLE.  They fall down ALL the time, and let me tell you, when they fall down they are loud! The first night we had them, one of them fell down around 3 AM and I  literally thought someone had broken into my house."
"1532","5","These pipes work well and are a fun bath time toy. My 3 year old loves them!"
"1533","5","My 5 year old enjoys these!"
"1534","5","This is a big hit with 2 year old grandson"
"1535","5","My kids love these in the tub!!"
"1536","5","Hours of fun!"
"1537","5","This was an instant hit with my 14 month old.  He<U+2019>s attracted to mechanical type toys with features like gears, twists, turns, etc. which is why these pipes initially caught my eye.  So far, these really capture his attention and he likes to investigate the different features.  After reading the reviews, I was a little confused about the ability to connect the pipes.  The pipes aren<U+2019>t made to physically connect, rather they can be arranged so that the pouring water from one pipe will pour into a different pipe.  Of course, this depends on your success at getting the suction cups to stick.  I have had mixed success, but getting some water on the suction cup does seem to help it stick.  In fact, when I have gotten one to adhere properly, it<U+2019>s actually difficult for my son to remove it.  Since we have plenty of fun playing with them individually, I haven't been too concerned with the suction feature.  A design detail I appreciate is that water has to filter through smaller openings and doesn<U+2019>t immediately rush through giving us time to watch what happens.  (Some reviews see this as a flaw, but I<U+2019>m counting this as a positive feature).  You can also rotate different parts of the pipes.  Overall, I<U+2019>m very pleased with this toy.  I think this is a well-made and well-thought-out toy.  Functional, fun, and imaginative design.  Highly recommend."
"1538","4","Bought these for my son (who is two) because he likes to build things and we were looking for more interactive water toys. However, like most bath toys with suction cups, they are mostly meant for tile, which sucks as our tub surround is fiber glass so everything sticks for a couple minutes until my son hits it the wrong way. I like the concept of these and they are well made and work exactly the way they should when water is poured into them."
"1539","1","Suctions didn't work."
"1540","5","Great bathtub toy for our 2 year old"
"1541","5","Kids love it!!  Makes bath time fun!"
"1542","5","Nice idea"
"1543","2","Doesn't stay attached"
"1544","5","My son plays with this in the shower all the time and loves it!"
"1545","5","Very nice product. Attaches well to the bath wall. Colorful design."
"1546","5","The suction cups stay stuck to ceramic tile and the side of the tub for days but come off easily when you want to move them around. They will randomly pop off in the middle of the night and land in the tub with a loud crash... but that is to be expected. Despite this, nothing has broken. Fun for a 16-month old, 5yr old, and and 8 yr old!"
"1547","5","So much fun!"
"1548","3","These are such a fun idea and I had high hopes for them.  That was crushed though when NONE of the suction cups actually stuck to our smooth run or tile.  My daughter still has fun filling them up and watching the water pour out and spin things...  But not nearly as much fun as I expected."
"1549","5","Great bath time toy and speedy delivery!"
"1550","5","These are amazing, my kids set these up so many different way and get the spinner turning. They use it to fill up different little pour toys they have. I got them as a fun gift along with bath color tablets, bubble bath and bath crayons. These are my favorite though because it's no mess, and it teaches them a bit about flow and mechanics.I keep thinking these would make a great gift basket for friends. All kids think bath time is the best time and these make it even better!!"
"1551","5","Great bathtub toy.  Grandson loves it!"
"1552","5","My daughter is 2 and she loved them <U+263A><U+FE0F>"
"1553","4","Decent."
"1554","5","Fantastic water toy for curious little toddlers and even older kids!"
"1555","5","My son loves these bath toys so much we got them as a birthday gift for one of his friends. They keep your child entertained and the water in the tub unlike some other toys. They air dry and have no hidden places for mold to grow. They sick to the wall with no problems. All the parts move without catching or not spinning."
"1556","5","So much fun.  Great design."
"1557","5","My 18 mo old loves pouring water from cup to cup or bowls on the kitchen floor. I saw these and thought GREAT - keep the water in the tub! he loved them. I like that they are flexible too and I can add to the set as he gets bigger. We gave him a spouted measuring cup to pour water from the bath to the tubes."
"1558","5","So much fun!"
"1559","4","The green one doesn't work. I think the hole is too small so the water doesn't come through fast enough. Otherwise, a fun activity at bath time. We also stuck them to our water table."
"1560","1","Kind of a dud for my kids ages 1 and 2 1/2. Alot of money for something they weren't thrilled with:("
"1561","1","Not what I expected it would not stick to the tile right above the tub it did stick to the tub but when you fill up the water wasnt enough space for the water to fall out of the boon pipes. I would recommended getting this for a like a 1 year old."
"1562","4","On one hand, it's more terrible plastic introduced into my house, the earth's environment, a future thrift shop, etc. But my kid likes them, and it's made bath time a lot easier. Meaning we will all die in a oven-like atmosphere because of products like this one! So buy two."
"1563","5","good"
"1564","3","If you have a smaller than 4X4 tiles, then it will not work as its designed. Water can't fall down into the other pipes to continue to make water path. Also, two of them are unattached itself then falls off multiple times during bath time."
"1565","2","Great in theory and the kids love playing with them, but they won't stick to the bathtub or tile above the tub. I spend the entire bath putting them back up after they fall again and again and my kids end up getting super frustrated. Disappointed."
"1566","3","I want to love these but only half of them work well. One if the spinners works great, the other rarely spins at all. My 2 yo enjoys them, just bummed that we can only use half."
"1567","1","grandchildren did not enjoy. Said too much trouble to be fun.  Had to throw them because the one with the light leaked into bathtub while child playing with it."
"1568","4","Don't stay suctioned our tile wall very long, but the kids still have fun playing with them. Wish it came with stronger suction cups."
"1569","5","So much fun for bath time! Both parents and toddler have a fun time putting these together. Great for my 3 year old."
"1570","5","My 3 boys love to play with these in the tub! It's been a few weeks now and they have held up well."
"1571","3","These are cool, but I didn't know the pipes had end caps and you can't connect them to each other so I was a bit disappointed."
"1572","5","Keeps the kids busy in the tub. They love getting in it, knowing the fun they will have."
"1573","1","Two problems with this item. One, the opening at the top is too small for my 2 year old to get much water in. Two, did not stick to the wall. We have a cheap shower, not tile. Maybe you'd have better luck with tile. I'd love to buy these again if the pipes were larger."
"1574","5","Perfect for our basement bar. Yes the crossbar is wood, but it really doesn't need to be iron to hold the cocktail napkins in place and looks really good. May end up buying another one for the family room coffee table."
"1575","4","This is a very simple bath toy and the colors are nice. My toddler loves it because he likes to play with water. He also positions the pipes on the wall so water trickles out from one into another. I thought he'd quickly get bored with it but he keeps playing with it."
"1576","5","Love these! Great purchase!!"
"1577","2","My daughter didn't use it. She loved her animal ones similar to this product, but these just sat. Not much fun :("
"1578","1","Functionality, very little.  Really the only one that works is the white/clear one with the screw-looking wheel. They either shoot the water out too far or just drip out, most of the items designed to spin don't turn easily enough with water, you need a jet stream.  Also the suction cups are really bad, they aren't positioned on each pipe correctly so some of them sag and you can't line them up or make use of them together.  We use a baby monitor system when our lil man goes to sleep and these things fall off of the wall and hit the tub quite loudly; the monitor picks it up very well and it startles us. Would NOT buy again."
"1579","2","Would return this but not worth my time. I have stone around bathtub and will not stick"
"1580","2","Doesn't do much for my 14 month old. Kind of a boring product."
"1581","1","Small, cheap, not what I expected."
"1582","1","These don't stick to anything except the bottom of the top. You can't use them as intended. One of them came broken. So disappointed"
"1583","4","Very cute toy for the bath. I do wish the suction cups works better. They have to be on a ultra smooth surface to stick for any length of time. My tile has a textured surface so I can't make a long waterfall with them."
"1584","4","Huge hit with our 2.5 yr old!  Didn't stain our tub, towels, or kid yet and used 3 tabs per bath!!!"
"1585","2","Dumb. We only have a tub. My daughter always fills the tub to the top, so there is't enough room to make a line. But still. They're dumb."
"1586","3","These pipes are just okay. I was under the impression that they could kind of funnel water into one another but they pretty much have to be used individually as thw water just barely trickles out."
"1587","1","Kids weren't interested"
"1588","1","My kids LOVED these. But we've only had the a few months and they a filled with black mold! We put all bath toys on a basket with holes rinse and drain and air dry after every use! So disappointed"
"1589","4","What a cute/different idea.  I was so excited to try these out.  I just wish there was a better way to keep them on the tub because they kept falling down."
"1590","4","Minus 1 star because if you have a ""painted"" tub, these don't stick so well. (I can't explain the tub...we rent an apartment, but it appears to be painted with waterproof white if you look really closely at where it meets the unpainted shower wall.) We just stick them to the shower wall.I would get 1 package per child... these are a lot of fun to arrange on the wall in a line so that the water flows from one tube into another tube.The kids don't get tired of these... but if you want to kick up the fun factor after a while (or right away) definitely pair them with color tabs.Our colors were a little different: white straight, blue T, pink J, orange straight spiral, pink bentIf your tubes start getting a grimy residue from soap/dirt/hard water, soak and swish in a bleach-water mixture and rinse clean"
"1591","3","These are okay, they are pretty fun in the tub, but not amazing. If you wanted to get them all working together, you would have to have a really high tub though! They would need a tall vertical surface if you wanted them to feed into each other. You would also need a constant stream of water, otherwise get ready to pour water into them every 3 seconds! We haven't yet got them working together, and they are only so much fun by themselves. The ones with the fans are the most fun.Altogether, I am glad they are in the tub with the rest of the toys, but they aren't really stand-out bath toys. My child has a lot more fun with the toys bobbing around the tub."
"1592","5","These simple pipes were an instant hit with my 18 month old grand-daughter.  She loves to pour in the water and watch the wheels spin on the two with moving parts.  Suction cups stick well to tiles, but also to the ceramic bathtub to discourage her from standing in the tub. This was the first time we've noticed that she knows some of her colors!  She can point out Orange, Yellow, Blue and White. Pink she isn't so sure about :). (Her engineer daddy likes them, too, making a chain reaction course for the water to flow.)"
"1593","2","When I opened the package from the store for first time, the pieces had been so tightly jammed in that 2 of the suction cups were misshapen and would not stick to the tub. It seemed after several baths that they would stick somewhat. So I would recommend maybe dumping them in hot water, if you encounter this. Not warm, hot.After time and use the suction cup parts that insert into the toy to fasten them together get moldy and even after soaking in bleach water I was unable to get the tiny crevices clean. They do not come apart for cleaning.Overall, this is not a toy I would recommend for the tub."
"1594","1","Very fun my son loves these"
"1595","1","I hesitated for about 6 months before I bought these, and now I<U+2019>m bummed I did. We have fiber glass bath walls, and they don<U+2019>t stick. They stick to the tub for about 2 <U+201C>pours<U+201D> and then they start to slide down. The most disappointing part is the actual toy...the water runs through them so quickly, my child barely gets to see it happens. And the one with the bottom <U+201C>leak<U+201D> is just that...it just kinda leaks out. Disappointed as it<U+2019>s hart to find good bath toys, but especially for $15, these are not it."
"1596","2","They all stick to the wall but they lean improperly so if you line then up to make a long chain they simply don't work right. Also the flow on some of them is really slow so you cant put them above a spinner bc there's never enough flow to make it work.  I like the different pieces that make the kids think and manipulate, however the they don't work as pictured."
"1597","5","We LOVE these pipes. Purchased as a new toy for my four year old for the bath. Grown ups in our house have just as much fun playing with them as he does. A few reviewers said that they do not drain into each other well but I find that to be untrue.  I will be giving these as gifts to a lot of little people in the future! Also, the colors we received are different than those pictured (same colors, different colors on different pipes)."
"1598","1","I'm SHOCKED Heise have such great reviews. Like other ""1 star-ers"" have noted, these don't stick well at all to the walls of the tub OR above the tub on the shower wall. They barely trickled water out the way they are intended and I couldn't get them to work properly. Sorely disappointed."
"1599","2","Really hard for kids to set these up. As others have mentioned, the water stream changes it<U+2019>s arc distance as they drain. So hard to get them lined up.But the biggest issue is the terrifying  crash when they fall off the wall in the middle of the night!"
"1600","5","Got these for my son for his first birthday. I figured he'd still need time to grow into them, but he likes to bang them on things and throw them, and they have held up well through his abuse. My 3.5 and 5.5-year-old daughters really enjoy them. Pouring is a fascinating activity at that age :)."
"1601","3","My son loves them!! But, he and I both get a bit frustrated when they don't really work well together. Only one spins great when water it's poured down and the others seem to work if you flush a huge cup of water down it. They also don't work well together, no matter what way we try to position them only about 2 can work together. The suction cups work pretty well.But he seems to like them!He also saw the paper that came with them and immediately wanted the gears and is now obsessed with gears. After reading reviews on the Boon gears (only bc the pipes worked okay) I, unfortunately don't think I will be getting him the gears."
"1602","5","Love these! They stick well to our tiled wall in the bathroom. So far they have not molded like some bath toys do (had for a month and a half) as the water doesn't seem to stand in any of them. Good solid plastic construction."
"1603","4","Unfortunately we have a tiled upper tub so they don't stick well on that but they do on the regular tub it just limits building abilities.  Not really a product fault but I was hoping they'd have a little better suction power.  Overall though my kids do really like them."
"1604","1","Upon arrival it did not work. Even tried changing the batteries. it beeped each time and then died. Very disappointed. I will be returning it."
"1605","2","Got these as a gift for my 3yr old. Great idea! However... we cannot get these buggers to stick to the walls of our shower or bathtub for more than a minute! My little guy was very frustrated."
"1606","5","Love this product.  Decided to get it after my kids seemed to get bored of the same old cars and ships in the bath.Both of my kids loved playing with these from day one and have not lost interest so far.  They even want to play with it in the shower.Have had no issues with the suction of the pipes sticking to the wall so far for the bath or shower.Highly recommend to add more fun for your kids in the bath or shower."
"1607","1","My son was given these for his birthday and within a month they have gotten moldy right where the suction cup and pipe meet. Very dissappointing. Never would have imagined these getting moldy, but they did."
"1608","1","These are unusable because they don't even stay suctioned to the tub wall for five minutes. As soon as the water gets poured in, most of the pipes just fall right off. Should be redesigned."
"1609","4","They are fun.  The L shaped fan won't spin at all for us with water.  The spiral (ours is orange, turquoise in the picure) is really awesome."
"1610","5","These and the gears have been a fun addition to bath time! My littles love them!"
"1611","3","These work as described but my 20 month old doesn't find them very exciting. I was hoping she'd find them as entertaining as running bath water but they are just ok."
"1612","5","Endless fun for my boys. We bought this set 2 years ago and they still enjoy them. Now ages 3 and 5. The suction cups stick well unlike some that constantly fall off. The fun bright colors are attractive and they like all the different ways water flows through them."
"1613","1","I'm not sure if it is just the product I received but these don't stick well at all. It's a great concept but once the back gets wet they are unreliable, so the little one can only move it and make one combination and then they just keep falling off the wall. I am returning."
"1614","3","Don<U+2019>t put the suction cups in the dishwasher. They can lose their shape."
"1615","5","Great Product!  Purchased this as a Christmas Gift for our Nephew and then for my toddlers.  They are larger in size than appear which makes it fun for the kids in the tub.  Have great durability and strong suction to the tub.  Good for my 20 month old who is learning eye hand coordination and cause and effect.  Would highly recommend this product."
"1616","5","Possibly the best bath toys I've gotten for my kids. This brand makes really creative toys for bathtime."
"1617","5","My son has loved playing with these. They are a bathtime favorite. Easy to use."
"1618","5","I purchased this toy because my 2 boys (2.5 and 1 year) LOVE the bath and needed something new. The price was good especially since I got them 40% off at BRU with another bath purchase.Both of my boys have been playing with these in the tub now for over 20 minutes! They haven't even touched their other toys!They stick to my tub wall pretty well and I can re-arrange when they are bored of current design' I would recommend to others needing a fun new bath toy!"
"1619","2","There are other tub toys that would be more fun. Only a few funnel the water enough to effect the next tube, and one of the heats doesn't spin. And, the suction isnt the greatest. Disapponted."
"1620","4","Colors differ from pack to pack. There was one pipe that didn't work effectively but once I took the plastic piece out, it was better. My 13 month old really liked them!"
"1621","5","My 2 year old and my 6 year old both love these."
"1622","5","Cute toy, easy to rinse out. Our 18 month old loves it!"
"1623","3","Cute idea, had trouble getting them to stick,but my son still had fun!"
"1624","5","These did not dissappoint. They are pricey but my toddler and preschooler are loving the endless combinations of pouring water through these. Great learning toy."
"1625","5","My 1 and 2 year old love playing with these in the bath, we bought this product with the boon jellies<U+00A0>Boon Jellies Suction Cup Bath Toys. The suction is great and the colors are fun now we only have crying when they have to get out of the bath."
"1626","5","Received these as a gift, and my little one loves to play with them."
"1627","5","My nieces (4 1/2 years and 20 months) LOVE these toys for the bathtub! The pipes are a nice change to their normal toys because there is no throwing or squirting of water like with other toys and all of the water actually stays in the tub."
"1628","1","These are such a great idea but do not stay on the tile, tub, or even metal baking sheets. They do, however, stick pretty well to my metal spaghetti pot. Beyond that, they just slide or pop off within a minute or two (if you're lucky). Disappointed."
"1629","5","Perfect addition to our bath time fun!!! My boys love them!!!!"
"1630","5","My son loves playing with these in the tub!!! Glad I purchased."
"1631","5","Great toys for the bath and the kids love them!"
"1632","5","We were in desperate need of new bath entertainment! These are awesome. My 1 year old loves to just dump water in them and my 3 year old loves to arrange them so they all flow into one another. These are a hit for sure. They work on our bath/ shower, but they are suction cups so if you have tile or a textured shower i could see sticking them all over could be a bit of a challenge."
"1633","5","2 year old son loves these! Great gift for any toddler."
"1634","3","My boys like the idea of these toys, but unfortunately we have tile surround in their tub. The suction sticks to the tub walls, but not tile. Would be better if they could stick on the walls - just a heads up if your bath has tile!"
"1635","4","Make sure you don't have a textured shower before you buy! Luckily, the bath tub is smooth so we can at least play with these."
"1636","5","My son loves it. He pretty much plays everyday in the bath"
"1637","5","I just got these for my 22 month old as our existing bath toys were starting to get boring... My son loves to experiment with putting water through hem and moving them to different positions on the tub wall. I am very happy with this purchase and love that the colors are gender neutral."
"1638","3","Look cool but son isn't very interested in them."
"1639","5","My one-year-old and four-year-old both love playing with these in the tub. Unlike other reviewers though, ours stick so well that I have to help my kids get them off for them to move them around. My four-year-old is pretty good at positioning them to work together. My little one just gets a kick out dumping water into them and watching it run through. Very entertaining. Well worth it."
"1640","5","At first I thought the suction cups were horrible, but my mom told me to spit on them. Now they work perfectly."
"1641","5","My 3 year old loves playing with this. Nice little bath toy <U+0001F44D>"
"1642","5","My boys both love these! They grew bored quickly with the foam bath toys and they love watching water pour (from faucets, the refrigerator, etc.), so I figured these would be a Huge hit. They are still under a year old, so they need mommy or daddy's help most of the time, but these add lots of smiles and giggles to our bath time!"
"1643","5","I got these for my 3 year old. She loves them!! The colors are fun and they keep her busy the whole bath. They do fall off if you don't stick them on good enough. Worth the money though and make bath time fun!!"
"1644","3","I want to really like these but the suction cups came out of the package a little folded and they won't suction to the tub...my kids love them but we can't use as intended."
"1645","5","Fun bath toy for the kids."
"1646","5","Nice!"
"1647","1","I was excited about this product when I received it. It looks better than the traditional toddler guard rails and unlike some of the poor reviews state, it is far superior to a pool noodle in that it doesn't move around, and is much taller than a pool noodle would be. However, during my 2 year olds FIRST night in his big bed and before midnight he fell out of bed. ?????? This may work if your child doesn't move much at night...buuuuut definitely didn't work for us."
"1648","4","My boys both love these! They grew bored quickly with the foam bath toys and they love watching water pour (from faucets, the refrigerator, etc.), so I figured these would be a Huge hit. They are still under a year old, so they need mommy or daddy's help most of the time, but these add lots of smiles and giggles to our bath time!"
"1649","4","I got these for my 3 year old. She loves them!! The colors are fun and they keep her busy the whole bath. They do fall off if you don't stick them on good enough. Worth the money though and make bath time fun!!"
"1650","4","I want to really like these but the suction cups came out of the package a little folded and they won't suction to the tub...my kids love them but we can't use as intended."
"1651","1","I made the bad mistake of purchasing this item also. I didn't read the review. For $10 you expect a cute little Velcro wallet. However this does look like the picture but it is a very sad excuse for a wallet. Such a rip off!! Not a $10 wallet more like a dollar store $1 item!"
"1652","1","This was such a disappointment. My grandson waited patiently for 2 days (eternity for him) to receive his Paw Patrol wallet. When we opened the package he inspected it and looked sad. He said this doesn't look like my brothers wallet. He was referring to just a normal kids wallet. Nothing expensive nor special but certainly made of better material and craftsmanship!!!"
"1653","1","Gave 1 star, though it certainly deserves less than that.  This wallet is NOT as described, at all.  It is simply a thin, cheap piece of material w/a Paw Patrol design on it, no Velcro fastener, nothing.  Totally not worth the money and it's  shame that such misleading descriptions are allowed."
"1654","4","Very basic child<U+2019>s wallet. Bought this for my Paw Patrol obsessed son who wanted a wallet just to have one, and this has satisfied him. But if you are wanting a wallet that a child can actually use to store money, this isn<U+2019>t it. The image quality is good,  but the material is very flimsy, and it can only hold a few bills at max, no coins, pictures, or cards. So I would recommend this for play and that<U+2019>s it."
"1655","1","I have never seen a product as cheaply made as this!  IT CANNOT BE RETURNED.  I don't know why I didn't read the reviews before ordering it.  Make yourself a wallet out of a sheet of paper or plastic bag before ordering this.  Why does Amazon sell this type of poorly made product that cannot be returned?"
"1656","1","This was just a complete waste of money.  It feels like paper folded into a square. You can't even put actual money into without it falling out. I wish i would have read the reviews but the picture makes it look like a regular velcro wallet. If i could give this negative stars, I would.  Although this wallet is for a toddler, this particular toddler has standards. He's gonna be pissed. Lol"
"1657","2","Was not overly impressed with this wallet. It came folded crooked, which drives me nuts, and feels cheaper than I had hoped. I thought about sending it back but figured for the price I paid I would keep it. My son doesn't care how cheap it feels and looks."
"1658","1","I learned my lesson here, I definitely should have read the reviews. I bought this wallet for my son and thought he would love the velcro closure to keep his money in. Well, this wallet is basically just a folded piece of plastic, no velcro closure at all. I would definitely not recommend this at all. And, I tried to return it but the shipping cost as much as this wallet, so now I'm out $8 for a useless item. VERY disappointed."
"1659","1","Really really cheap quality. It<U+2019>s going to be a stocking stuffer so I wasn<U+2019>t looking to spend a fortune. For the price you pay I guess you get what you pay for but I see it lasting only a few days, could probably rip it myself because it<U+2019>s so thin"
"1660","2","Very cheaply made, should have bought a $5 men's one from Walmart.  No space for coins and the fold doesn't even hold dollars without having to fold them :(  Glad my kiddo loves Paw Patrol, but I am pretty disappointed that it inst really functional as a wallet."
"1661","1","I was desperate for a wallet for my son's Christmas stocking. The other wallets that I wanted to get had been selling out before I had the chance to purchase one. This wallet reflects my desperation. Like most of the other reviews say, it's a cheap piece of crap. And oddly large. It's bigger than my husband's wallet! I suppose it will get us by until we can get a nice one."
"1662","2","You get what you pay for on this item.  It is cheap and the quality isn't the greatest.  It is a plastic type material and pretty flimsy.  It is fine for my four-year old who doesn't carry it with him daily and really just keeps it on his shelf, but I would be concerned if he wanted to carry it around in fear of it ripping."
"1663","2","My son loves this because it has paw patrol on it so I'm not returning it. But I wouldn't recommend it. The quality is very poor. I paid a little less for another wallet at the same time for my other son and it is much higher quality and includes a zipper pocket. This is only for play and basically will end up in a landfill in about a month, which makes me nuts."
"1664","1","Too bad I couldn't leave zero stars! Don't buy this disposable wallet! Also note that it cannot be returned, it's a total waste of money. It's made of glorified paper and very thin and flimsy. Also, way too big for a little guys pocket. Go to the dollar store and get something for $1, it's a better use of your money."
"1665","1","This thing shouldn't be more than 2 dollars  its like a folded up piece of fabric that looks like money could lay in it."
"1666","1","I cannot believe this product would even suffice as a wallet. The gift was for my nephew. When he got it, he asked me if it was made out of a paper towel. I was so embarrassed at how cheap it was made that I purchased a different wallet since this one canNOT be returned. It's literally a wallet that you can purchase from a Dollar Tree ON SALE."
"1667","1","Don't waste your money! Super thin material looks like it cost less than 50 cents to make! Piece of junk."
"1668","3","Very cheap quality and nowhere to keep change. Considering kids like coins, seems like a must have. However the paw patrol part is awesome and made my kid happy. It's cheap enough that it can be upgraded later without heartburn."
"1669","1","Very cheaply made. My 4- year old didn<U+2019>t like it because it didn<U+2019>t close and it basically just some type of fabric cut in half with the paw patrol squad on it. Also, it doesn<U+2019>t match description the wallet arrived bent all funky and doesn<U+2019>t have Velcro to keep it closed as stated in description. I tried to return but they don<U+2019>t accept returns. Save your money and look else where. I think even the dollar store has better quality wallets than this with designs as well."
"1670","3","I was excited to receive this for my son but when it came it was more of just something to play with instead of a real wallet. I'll probably have to get him another wallet to save his money in."
"1671","1","I should have read the reviews on this wallet before purchasing.  It's s piece of crap.  No place to hold coins and very thin papery material.  It's going straight in the trash can, and I'm getting one of the trifold Star Wars wallets that is only $1 more and made like a real wallet.  We used to have one but it was stolen."
"1672","1","Not worth the $4. Imagine a wallet made out of duct tape. There is no velcro to hold the wallet shut, there is no change spot, the money pocket isn't even sewn on all sides. I just wanted something small for my little Paw Patrol fan to put her money in to take to the store, and this will only be used for play at home."
"1673","1","I returned this item b/c it doesn't match the description at all it says it has velcro and it does not.  Not very good quality"
"1674","1","Product is cheaply made. Definitely not worth the money. I wouldn<U+2019>t recommend. I wanted to return it as soon as I opened it. Junk"
"1675","3","3 stars because my 4yr old loved it.... However this is very cheap. With a great chance of this wallet getting lost, im not to worried about it. For this age it will work. But if you are looking for a nice better quality.. Might need to spend more than $5."
"1676","2","Thought this would be a cute first little wallet for my 3 year old grandson but the quality of the wallet was very flimsy. Of course it didn't cost that much but I wanted to send it back and look for one that was made better but the shipping was more than the wallet so I just kept it and will probably donate it to goodwill."
"1677","5","Bought this for my grandson & HE loves it. When you are almost 5 you need a place to keep your bucks!"
"1678","3","My son loves this wallet, he<U+2019>s 4. But I think it<U+2019>s quite cheaply made. One of those <U+201C>you get what you pay for<U+201D> kinda things!"
"1679","2","Cheaply made my little boy loves it cause it<U+2019>s paw patrol but not good quality for the money"
"1680","1","I bought this for my 2 year so that he could be <U+201C>just like daddy<U+201D> and carry a piece of money around with him. This item is cheap, not worth the money at all. It<U+2019>s like a plastic type material. Go with a more reputable maker... this isn<U+2019>t worth the money and cost even more to send back. Won<U+2019>t even hold one dollar properly for my 2 yr old."
"1681","1","Super cheap quality. Feels like paper and once you put a couple dollars in the wallet it won<U+2019>t even fold shut! This is ridiculous, I could find a better quality one at a dollar store. Don<U+2019>t waste your money."
"1682","1","The cheapest thing ive ever purchased in my life. Dont waste your money on this."
"1683","3","Exactly how describes in the reviews but my two year old loves it."
"1684","3","It is okay for kids, but don't expect it to last long.  The material is very thin, almost papery."
"1685","5","My four year old wanted a wallet so badly, he really likes his paw patrol wallet! The price was perfect!"
"1686","1","This wallet is less than dollar store quality, it is made of a paper like fabric"
"1687","2","OK so for the price I didn't expect a whole lot but I did expect it to at least fit in my son's back pocket but it doesn't. I  wish it were smaller but overall it's not a bad little  Wallet.  Though, hopefully it will hold up because the material is similar to a  plasticky Tote bag  you would buy at a dollar store."
"1688","2","Cheaply made.  The only reason I didn't return it is because it costed more to return it than it did to buy it."
"1689","5","Pleasure doing business with you. My grandson loves the wallet."
"1690","3","It is cute but really flimsy and not well made. My son likes it so that's the important thing."
"1691","1","Not even worth it. It<U+2019>s garbage and cheaply made. It was a waste of money."
"1692","4","Bought this item for my nephew for Christmas and he absolutely loved it."
"1693","1","Read reviews people- I sure didn<U+2019>t.  This is such a cheap wallet, I don<U+2019>t think my daughter can even put money in it without it falling out. Money wasted."
"1694","3","Its like  cheap fabric like a box spring material"
"1695","4","Got it in in great time. When I opened the package it was a little thinner than I originally thought it would be. Giving for a Christmas gift to my 3 year old who will think its just like daddys so he will for sure love it. Overall...good product for the price."
"1696","5","My 3 year old loves this wallet. Its cute, quality and has several compartments."
"1697","4","great wallet for a young boy"
"1698","5","son loves it and made well."
"1699","4","Got it for my grandson....I think he will like it."
"1700","3","Nothing super special about this, the material is cheap and flimsy, but it serves the purpose, i got this to go with my sons cash register ao he can keep hos play money in it."
"1701","2","Pretty flimsy but ok."
"1702","5","Perfect first wallet."
"1703","5","Just what out grandson wanted."
"1704","1","I should have read the reviews first... I feel scammed. This is the cheapest wallet I have ever seen. I do not feel they are worth the price. These honestly should only sell for $1. My son needed a full functioning wallet. Any money put in here is going to fall out and there's not sections for a coin slot."
"1705","4","Somewhat cheap material and the ends don't close so anything can fall out. BUT it works for my 3 year old and he was very excited!"
"1706","3","The wallet is not really what I thought it would be, it's not very durable material, but my grandson loved it, so that's all that matters."
"1707","5","My grandson loves it."
"1708","5","Very thin material but it is cheap and did arrive fast. Good stocking stuffer"
"1709","1","I can't  believe this person is getting away with selling such poor quality products. It DOES NOT have velcro as stated. This should be a $1 want a refund."
"1710","5","My grandson loves this birthday present."
"1711","1","So disappointed with this product. I wish I would have read the reviews before I bought it. It is a total piece of junk. I bought if for my nephew as a birthday present, I was so embarrassed to give this to him. So cheaply made, I don<U+2019>t think it<U+2019>s worth 99cents."
"1712","1","Cheep material and bad quality"
"1713","3","CHINTZY BUT OK FOR A REAL YOUNG CHILD.  I SINCE BOUGHT A TRIFOLD WHICH WORKS BETTER FOR AN OLDER CHILD."
"1714","1","Horrible quality! Too big for my son to fit in his pocket and extremely flimsy. I would not recommend."
"1715","1","It's really a cheap feeling and looking product. I bought it for my Paw Patrol obsessed 3 year old. He is 3 and doesn't need a ""nice"" wallet but I could see this being from the dollar store and not for the price I paid for.I would not recommend this wallet."
"1716","1","GARBAGE!!!!! Not worth $4 more like 50cent. This wallet felt like paper laminated!!!"
"1717","1","Quality is poor"
"1718","1","Ugh complete disappointment. Do not buy it. It is so cheap looking and the material is terrible. I now have to purchase a different gift. Definitely not what i expected."
"1719","1","Made very cheap!"
"1720","2","My son loves Paw Patrol which is why he wanted this wallet. Mom isn<U+2019>t a big fan as there is no zipper or velcro keeping the money inside secure."
"1721","1","Cheaply made. I was expecting something close to the other character wallets I<U+2019>ve bought for my other boys. This one is very disappointing."
"1722","1","I ordered this as a stocking stuffer so I can<U+2019>t send it back or I would but total crap very thin doesn<U+2019>t stay closed money will all fall out don<U+2019>t waist your money so disappointed paper thin"
"1723","4","Cute little wallet. But nothing really to it. Doesn't hold money too well. Use it just for play."
"1724","5","Came as pictured I was expecting it to be a bit smaller but not complaining. Package is easy to open and frustration free."
"1725","1","This product is complete crap. There is no way it's going to last a day in the hands of a child.  So so disappointed I couldn't return this item.  I've. Never gone to the trouble of returning items or even writing reviews but this product should not be sold."
"1726","1","Crap product and can't return it. Don't purchase from this seller."
"1727","1","Not made well and way overpriced, should be $1 at most! It's already ripping at the seams. The absolute only reason we kept it was because our toddler son waited in anticipation of it and was excited because it's Paw Patrol."
"1728","1","Wish I read the reviews before buying this junk.  Doesn't even hold dollar bills and mine was seen together at the top so you couldn't put any bills in it.  Save yourself the money and don't buy from this seller..."
"1729","5","My almost 3 year old wanted a wallet like daddy and loves this one!"
"1730","1","This thing was basically paper folded into a wallet, don<U+2019>t waste your money!"
"1731","5","very cute wallet for my 5 year old grandson!"
"1732","5","The wallet is great, it does not Velcro closed, just folds up."
"1733","2","I wasn't expecting anything fancy. The material is that of a tarp covering. Too big to fit in the back pocket of a kid. I guess for a 5 year old it isn't that bad of a starter wallet."
"1734","3","It is made of plastic and very thin which makes it hard to close"
"1735","1","This was a complete waste of money. I purchased as a gift and I'm too embarrassed to even give it due to how cheap it looks and feels. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE! Would have rated it a zero if that was an option!"
"1736","1","cute but literally is paper thin and  crinkles like thick newspaper :( total junk :("
"1737","3","Material looks cheap but its cute for a beginners wallet"
"1738","2","Oversized. I mean HUGE. Doesn't even fit in my pocket really. Too big for a kids wallet."
"1739","2","no closures, too large for a little boys pocket, even too big for big brothers (size 8 pants) pocket."
"1740","1","Very thin and cheap made. Very disappointed. Not at all what I was expecting."
"1741","5","would purchase again if needed"
"1742","1","It's almost like it is made out of paper. Very cheap."
"1743","2","My son liked the fact it<U+2019>s paw patrol, but it<U+2019>s a pretty flimsy wallet. There<U+2019>s no Velcro to keep it closed & pops open if you put money in it."
"1744","1","My son wanted a wallet for his allowance. This was very poorly made. I honestly found a better wallet at my local dollar store."
"1745","1","Cheaply made. But nice for my four year old"
"1746","4","Very cute, inexpensive wallet for a young fan of the show. The quality could probably have been better, but it gets the job done."
"1747","3","Cool wallet for my grandson. The only negative is how big the actual wallet is. Too big for my little guy"
"1748","4","really thin material but good for a beginner wallet"
"1749","1","Cheap cheap cheap. More like a piece of fabric from the $1 store. Total waste of $12 (bought 2) My kids will love it for about 2.5 seconds then it'll rip, I'm sure. Don't bother."
"1750","3","Very very thin but tough material- opens on end so won<U+2019>t really hold the papers my toddler would like it to- everything falls out of bill section."
"1751","1","As soon as I took it out of the packaging it started to peel. I will never buy again. totally not worth the price."
"1752","1","I literally held this in my hand thinking I was holding a coupon of some sort. Cheap"
"1753","1","I made the mistake of not reading reviews. The details for this wallet say it <U+201C>features Velcro closure<U+201D> it most certainly DOES NOT! Very cheap material & not recommended;("
"1754","1","ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!!! Do not buy from them. The item I received is not how it was described online. My 3 year old is devastated by the trash that was sent to us in the mail."
"1755","5","Great kids wallet!"
"1756","1","Not what I expected. I don't like the material neither do I like the fact that it wouldn't close once my grand placed his money in it."
"1757","1","Basically like a piece of paper shaped into a wallet. Not what we had intended. Not worth it to send back."
"1758","2","Very cute but there is no Velcro closure it just folds to close. Very disappointed wanted my son to have a wallet that closed all the way"
"1759","5","Awesome"
"1760","1","The item was paper thin my four-year-old soon as he put some money in it it ripped"
"1761","5","As expected but the mailing envelop looked like it had been run over."
"1762","5","Adorable wallet"
"1763","2","Cute wallet, but super cheaply made!"
"1764","3","Kids love it but the ""coin pouch"" does not hold coins in."
"1765","1","Do not purchase this. I bought this for my 4 year old to keep his money he earns in it, but it is so crappy I can't even let a 4 year old use this."
"1766","1","I'm so disappointed it's not what I expected at all.  wish i could give half a star"
"1767","2","This wallet is pretty thin and flimsy. Would not buy again."
"1768","1","Very Cheap thin paper/plastic. Not even worth a few dollars. Will tear apart after a few days"
"1769","4","Good wallet for the price"
"1770","1","There is no Velcro to close this wallet."
"1771","1","It<U+2019>s plastic- like material.FALSE ADVERTISING- says it has Velcro, it does not!!!!!"
"1772","4","gift"
"1773","5","My Godchild loved it...."
"1774","3","I'm satisfied and dissatisfied. This item came with correct design and the picture looks great. However, the product is VERY cheap material."
"1775","1","Very poorly made. The stitching was not straight and parts of it were not even stitched together."
"1776","3","This was a gift for my 4 year old nephew who loves Paw Patrol.  Would have been better if it were smaller and zipped like the other wallets.  To big."
"1777","1","Not what I was expecting at all. Plastic wallet not very well made. Would have returned but the shipping was the cost of the item. thought it would be like the little wallets we would get when I was a kid."
"1778","3","Feels very cheap"
"1779","2","Very cheap material."
"1780","1","I should have looked at the reviews before buying.  Cheaply made, no velcro or anything to keep it together.  Seems like money could fall out easily.  I returned after receiving. Not worth the purchase."
"1781","1","This is an very cheap material almost like a coated paper product.  Do you buy this!  This is not wallet material.  I would not pay the $0.20 it cost to make this in China."
"1782","1","This is junk. Material is not even cloth, very cheaply made. Money does not even stay in it. Not what I was expecting at all and am returning this."
"1783","3","This is SO cheap and flimsy, its made out of material that is like paper.  My 5 year old is fine with it, but he'll just be playing with it anyway."
"1784","1","Very bad quality"
"1785","5","LIKE IT"
"1786","1","Very disappointed with this product. It is very thin and cheaply made. Seems like something from the dollar store. Not happy with it at all."
"1787","5","Adorable"
"1788","1","I wish I had read the reviews first. This is a piece of junk. Would return but it'd cost more to return than its worth. It'll end up in the trash."
"1789","2","Make sure you read the description. Super bummed."
"1790","1","It wasn't expensive but good grief this is so cheap, will not even keep money in there, the money just falls out. I'm disappointed because this was for my son."
"1791","2","This is not what I expected at all. It's very thin and cheaply made.  I guess I thought it was a Velcro wallet.  It's only for my two year old but still."
"1792","1","Material was not as expected very cheap. Broke as my 5 year old tries to put his money in."
"1793","3","Very thin, bi-fold- made from cheap material. My son loves it bc its Paw Patrol, but there's no place for coins"
"1794","5","My toddler love it"
"1795","1","It broke right when we tried to put money in it. Really bad quality"
"1796","1","Way more flimsy than we expected :( disappointed. It's ok if it's just a toy but not if you actually want your young one to hold money in it!"
"1797","1","Do not buy. Not only Cheap, IT IS DAMAGED AND YOU CANNOT RETURN TO THEM."
"1798","4","Kind of large to fit in a kids pocket but does the job for a toddler."
"1799","1","Very cheaply made. Nothing like i expected. Looks like it came from dollar tree. Not even worth the $4."
"1800","1","This wallet is incredibly flimsy and made of paper. My son was very disappointed when he opened it up."
"1801","5","I got this super cheap so I wasn't expecting much. It does feel cheap but it's holding up well and my kiddo loves paw patrol and it's teaching him to keep up with his money."
"1802","3","It was not as I expected. It is cheaper quality, however my four year old loves it. I would not be as likely to purchase another one."
"1803","1","Made out of thin plastic! Terrible quality!"
"1804","5","My friend kids love it <U+0001F60D>"
"1805","1","This look to cheep, not worth the money"
"1806","1","Item does not match description. No velcro closure and no zipper pocket for change. Disappointed."

"1808","1","Super cheap made! I could have bought this at the dollar tree! Very disappointed!"
"1809","3","There is no velcro to close the wallet."
"1810","2","Pretty cheaply made."
"1811","2","It is very cheaply made; however, for the price, I can<U+2019>t be too upset."
"1812","4","I thought this was Velcro- sad that its not... whatever u put in it will easily fall out."
"1813","1","Barely worth $1. Such a cheap piece or junk that I expect to find at a dollar store not listed for over $10. It's junk. I had to give it a star but it's literally maybe .5"
"1814","1","Bad quality.no return policy.i don<U+2019>t recommend at all."
"1815","5","Good price good quality"
"1816","5","Love his wallet."
"1817","1","Horrible quality! Yes it was bi fold like I expected but cheap quality. Material was consistency of  paper and was more like something you would expect to see at th dollar store."
"1818","1","Really cheaper and worst quality."
"1819","1","This wallet is so cheaply made and isn't allowed to be returned."
"1820","5","Great product! My son loves it!"
"1821","5","My 2yr old son loves his. Its exactly what I expected. <U+0001F44D>"
"1822","1","Practically made of paper.  Not even exaggerating.  This should be sold for $0.99.  Then it would be worth it.  It's cute, just very VERY cheap looking.  Luckily my son is only 3 and didn't notice."
"1823","1","I was disappointed in the poor quality of these wallets.  The stitching was poor and the fabric overlapped incorrectly."
"1824","1","Don't waste your money, it is sooooo cheaply made!  Much worse than standard kid's wallets."
"1825","1","Very disappointed with this. Expected it to be like most little boy wallets I see in the store, but it is very cheaply made. Would definitely look for something different."
"1826","1","Very cheaply made.  No secure way to keep bills in, and no change section."
"1827","5","Just as described!!! Fast shipping!!!"
"1828","1","Wouldn't recommend this at all. Complete waste of money"
"1829","5","The product I ordered appeared as the picture I<U+2019>m very satisfied"
"1830","1","Poor quality. One of the pockets isn<U+2019>t even completely sewn shut and it is a non-returnable item."
"1831","2","poor quality , its like paper thin and the graphics are horrible, it should be half the price. would not recommend this product for the price."
"1832","5","My 4 year old was very happy with this wallet, also very fast shipping."
"1833","1","Save your money!! I'm so upset that I wasted $10 on this ""wallet"". Looks like it came from the dollaw store. Poor quality. Total waste."
"1834","1","#Don't Buy is not worth it."
"1835","1","VERY CHEAPLY MADE..VERY DISAPPOINTED."

"1837","1","Piece of crap!!  Rip off!!  Do not buy!  Not even worth 10 cents!!  Save your $$$You cannot post without giving a star.  It should have minus star value."
"1838","4","A little thin but all in all he loves it because of Paw Patrol"

"1840","2","Cheesy plastic"
"1841","3","I was expecting better quality."
"1842","5","Bought this for my 2 year old & he loves it!"
"1843","1","So cheap.  Picture is blurry and the wallet is paper thin."

"1846","4","Kids enjoy it."
"1847","2","cheap poor quality"
"1848","1","Sooooo CHEAP !Cheaper than the Dollar Store !!"
"1849","5","This is the cutest little wallet. Perfect for my 3 year old."
"1850","1","Cheapest wallet I've ever seen."
"1851","2","Very cheaply made. Not impressed."
"1852","4","Very cute! Just like picture, using for stocking stuffer!"
"1853","1","Looks super cheap, like from a dollar tree."
"1854","5","I ordered the wallet on Saturday and recieved it today (Tuesday). My grandson loves his new wallet. Thank you."
"1855","1","extremely cheap and to big to fit in a little boys pocket. AWFUL!!"
"1856","5","Perfect, my little guy will love this!"
"1857","5","Perfect!!!"
"1858","1","Super cheap. Basically plastic tm"
"1859","1","Very thin material.  Felt would rip easy and had to return."
"1860","5","My son loves it"
"1861","5","My kid loved it"
"1862","1","Super cheap materials. Could have gotten the same thing with about the same quality it better at the dollar tree."
"1863","1","Was sooo disapointed a cheap piece of crap the the money falls right out would not recomend anyone to bye<U+0001F612>"
"1864","1","Horrible cheap product not worth $1."
"1865","1","Worst product and can<U+2019>t return!"
"1866","1","Chinsey"
"1867","5","Great product for 3 year old"
"1868","3","Needs to be smaller for the kids"
"1869","3","Not very good quality I bought for my 5 year old its very thin"
"1870","2","Not secure enough..."
"1871","5","Cute little wallet"
"1872","3","Kinda cheapy but you get what you pay. My son loved it."
"1873","1","Total piece of junk."
"1874","1","Very cheap quality, not worth what I paid."
"1875","1","VERY DISAPPOINTED, Very cheap quality, not what was expected"
"1876","1","I should have read the reviews. This is a very cheap product and would not recommend to anyone."
"1877","1","Very cheaply made. DO NOT BUY"
"1878","5","Great"
"1879","1","Poor quality"
"1880","1","Very cheap. Does not close with velcro (although the description says it does)."
"1881","1","I just received this in the mail for my sons Christmas tomorrow and am so dissapointed.  I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing.  It is very thin and has no substance.  He won't be able to take this out as I am afraid his money will fall out.  I have seen other wallets for half the price that are excellent construction.  I only got this because he really wanted paw patrol.  And I had to pay for the 2 day shipping to get it for Christmas and it took 3 days.  I would give this zero stars if I could."
"1882","1","Very disappointed !!! cheaply made."
"1883","5","My son loves it"
"1884","1","Like other's have said, horrible quality!! You can get a much better wallet for the same price. Wish I would have read the reviews first."
"1885","1","Do not buy. I paid $9 for the cheapest ""wallet"" I have ever seen. If you can even call it a wallet. No pocket for coins and it looks like it was made by a 5 year old. Extremely disappointed."
"1886","3","Overall it's not horrible.  The downfalls are that the money falls out very easily when my 3 year old has it.  We added velco to the inside to hold his change.  But he loves it because it is Paw Patrol!"
"1887","4","It's cute for a small boy's first wallet, but I feel like it's pretty cheaply made. Only pockets for dollar bills or cards. No pouch for change."
"1888","1","it's junk for the price.  looks like it's all made of thin plastic.  I would've been better off finding something at the dollar store!"
"1889","5","Amazing product. I strongly recommend these for your kids because paw patrol bifold set will bring smile on their face. This means a lot to parents. My son really liked it and paw patrol is his favorite and it is the special theme for his birthday party which is on this Saturday. I hope he enjoy to the core with the special theme with his friends. Thanks buyer."
"1890","1","Cheap, flimsy, plastic, waste of money. It does not even have zip for coins which is what most kids have at this age."
"1891","2","Not made weak. Money slips right out of it."
"1892","2","It looked very cheap."
"1893","1","It looks so cool in the picture, but it will be a disappointment. I know its a kids wallet but its just a cheap plastic folded in half with a picture of the paw patrol.  Be aware that this is not a great wallet its more of a toy that will not meet expectations"
"1894","2","I bought this as a stocking stuffer, seemed cheap and a fun idea.  However, even for $4 it isn't worth the money.  I think it is dollar store quality.  That said, it was $4 and shipped free to that total value is about right.  This wouldn't work for a real wallet - find for a toy."
"1895","1","this wallet is very very thin and cheap - looks like could have been sold at the dollar store- my son wanted a Paw Patrol wallet so bad though so when this came in the mail he didn't want me to return it and look for another one - we have had it about a month and you would think it was a year it's so worn all ready - it also has no Velcro or button closure- so just flops open"
"1896","1","This wallet is okay for holding paper money, but there isn't a secure place to store coins. Every time my 5 year old opens it, coins fall out. It does not have a velcro or zipper pouch for coins. I would not recommend wasting your money on this wallet."
"1897","1","I bought this for my grandson and a Disney wallet for my granddaughter - same price on Amazon.  The Disney wallet is great, but this is a piece of garbage.  It says it has a zipper closure for change, but it doesn't.  It is flimsy, made out of a terrible material.  It should get no stars.  I am surprised that Nick would allow their name on something like this."
"1898","1","Had to give a star but this doesnt deserve one Horrible, terrible, cheaply made,  my 3 year old doesn't even want this crap especially after he saw his brorhers with a different one. Don't waste your money on this crap, and then you cant even return it... who does that???"
"1899","1","It is really cute but made so cheaply I won<U+2019>t be giving it to my grandson. I bought it to hold his Christmas money but it<U+2019>s basically printed paper. Will return it."
"1900","1","Awful. Can<U+2019>t hold money. Does not Velcro close. Made of recycled paper. Very thin. Do not buy."
"1901","1","Horrible wallet.  No Velcro closure.  VERY cheap."
"1902","1","Paper thin material, looks cheap, I was disappointed."
"1903","1","I needed a wallet for my son and this is unusable.  His money would just fall right out of it, as it is terrible quality."
"1904","1","Very poor quality.  Disappointed"
"1905","2","Not worth the price. Looks cheap like those $1 reusable bags for groceries."
"1906","1","Wish I had read reviews first. Product not as described. I'll describe it...thin and seems made of paper. Don't waste your money."
"1907","1","This is a very thin cheap plastic"
"1908","1","Looks cheap. Not good quality"
"1909","3","Not quite what I expected but overall happy."
"1910","3","Not what i expected kind of cheaply  made"
"1911","5","Amazing product"
"1912","5","Our granddaughter loves these as part of her bath time play."
"1913","5","Bought this for me 1 1/2 year old great grandson.  He loves it!  Great fun for both tub and pool."
"1914","5","Lot of fun"
"1915","5","really cool, you will need to turn the light off in the bathroom for the full effect.  The kids do love it."
"1916","5","My neice loved it"
"1917","5","Very entertaining. My grandson loves it."
"1918","5","It's a hit with all of my kids. Good buy!"
"1919","5","Awesome bath toy!!"
"1920","5","Cool"
"1921","1","piece of crap.  Got water inside and stopped working after one use."
"1922","4","This has been our lifesaver! Our 1 year old boy is VERY handful in the bath. He stands, walks and crawls in the tub, licks the bottom of the tub, tries to drink the water coming out of the faucet - he just never stops moving. But now, he is so into this toy that he sits in the tub and just stares at it, bites and licks it for a good amount of time."
"1923","2","I<U+2019>m not sure how it works, not really interestedIt was supposed to be a gift for a child<U+2019>sbirthdayIt<U+2019>s very tiny and didn<U+2019>t even come in a box,Just a plastic bagI will look like the cheapest Aunt ever if I gaveThis to a child.  Looks like it came from the dollar store.  <U+0001F621>"
"1924","1","Used one time in the bathtub, it filled with water and now it won't work. I will definitely be returning this. Another thing that's upsetting, is in the description of the item, it says it gives your child something to play with in the bathtub alone and allow the parents time to themselves. Then says for ages 1-5. Please tell me parents of children ages 1-5 don't leave their children unattended in the bath tub..... I wouldn't recommend this toy."
"1925","2","The idea is great but the product itself is kinda cheap. When I received my first order there was a giant crack down the center so water immediately leaked inside and fried the board. The second one worked great for a second and now no longer works. Not really worth the money."
"1926","1","Bought this item as a recommendation from a friend. Although it was a little more than I wanted to spend on a baby bath toy, I went ahead and purchased it. When I received it, it was smaller than I expected and only have one light setting. My son was not even interested in the. We went ahead and used it in the tub and within 2 weeks of having it, the inside was filled with water and batteries were corroded. Thankful for Amazon's awesome customer service. They gave me a full refund. Don't waste your money!"
"1927","1","This toy is great when it works.  My granddaughter loves it.  But, I bought 3 of these and only 1 works.  The two that don<U+2019>t work had switch issues where you couldn<U+2019>t turn off the toy (for 1 of them) and the other would only work if you manually held down the switch.  Also, the 2 that don<U+2019>t work filled up with water and as a result, the wires are now corroded.  It<U+2019>s a shame because the 1 that does work is really fun for my granddaughter to watch as it changes colors...kind of like a light show.  I will never buy again though because of the other issues.  They are obviously very cheaply made.  <U+0001F44E>"
"1928","1","Very cool.  I have a light over tub in bathroom. Shut that off and it was the coolest tubby time for my 2 yr old!!! Love this thing!!!Update. A week later. Thing has water in it:( I even bought a new one because I thought maybe I didn<U+2019>t screw it together right enough.  Nope. Next one got water in it right away.  Don<U+2019>t bother.  Save ur $$$$."
"1929","1","I brought this for my grandchild.  Sadly, there was no battery spring in one of the battery cases, so it doesn't work, and since this item was purchased as a birthday gift, I didn't open it until I was past the return date, so I am stuck.  Very disappointing because I thought this might help him in his fear of water."
"1930","1","Packing was bubble wrap around the toy- not appealing at all. The toy does not seem like it's worth $15.95, more like $6. The seam around the toy is not completely sealed so we haven't tried to use it in the bath tub like it's intended use. I wouldn't buy this item again."
"1931","1","This bath toy needs to taken off the market! It<U+2019>s worthless in every way! It never fit together. It began leaking immediately. Within 5 minutes it was a dead toy. My two little ones were so disappointed."
"1932","1","Very cheaply made. Neat in concept, but is simply very cheap and doesn't function correctly. Mine has some sort of connection issue; the light will not stay on. Additionally, water leaks into the device no matter how i try to seal it."
"1933","1","Fake, doesn't work, extremely cheap & brittle plastic, was already cracked. Really small, takes AAA, but marked and advertised as taking AA."
"1934","1","the photo shows this as something much bigger than it is.  Doesn't even work 1/2 the time.  It is not worth getting for the price you are paying. If it was $3.00 - maybe, but $12.00 is really pushing the envelope."
"1935","3","its Smaller than the pic.. I gave it 3 starts based on appreaance (it<U+2019>s a gift) so I haven<U+2019>t tired it. But I was disappointed in the package it juts game in a clear bubble wrap.  Not a original box so as I mentioned it<U+2019>s a gift that I now have to buy a big for along with a gift bag."
"1936","1","Didn<U+2019>t work out of the box after several attempts. Was a birthday gift, double sldisappointment. And, of course, I tossed the packaging so couldn<U+2019>t return. Ugh."
"1937","2","I don't know why this rated higher than a 2-star. It is cheaply made and didn't even come in a box. The side was cracked open when I got it. It's basically all plastic so I don't know how it can be waterproof. And it didn't come with batteries."
"1938","3","I got this as a gift and was embarrassed at the packaging it came in - super cheap and looked like a ""knock off"" but my year old niece loves it and it works."
"1939","1","The single item arrives without any protective packing and it has a hole which let's the water in... In addition to the fact that this piece of plastic costs 15 a piece, and has no batteries.... It is a piece of crap!"
"1940","1","Absolutely isn<U+2019>t waterproof. It now doesn<U+2019>t always turn on. I literally just got it. Perhaps I got a defective one, but just an FYI."
"1941","1","Looks extremely cheaply made. Returning immediately. Wouldn't trust thing in the tub with a child"
"1942","1","The picture shows it way bigger than it is. I thought it was frisbee size and its apple size"
"1943","1","This toy is not waterproof! The first time into the tub and water got into the battery compartment and ruined it. Definitely returning!"
"1944","1","This came after a month and doesn<U+2019>t work. It doesn<U+2019>t even light up. The picture makes it look like it is several toys but it is only one small toy (that doesn<U+2019>t work). Would not recommend."
"1945","1","First the product is only one light up toy not 3 as shown in the picture for $16.00. Second I got this for my grandson's 1st Birthday The very first time he used it in the tub he threw it into the water and it hit the side of a fiberglass tub and got a huge crack. So now it is not safe as a bath tub toy.  Third it was so difficult to put the batteries in."
"1946","1","Used it moncas and water got in and corroded the battery. Waste of money"
"1947","2","We're three days in.  The good news is my kids love it.  The bad news is that after the first use it started retaining water then cutting off intermittently and getting dimmer.  Given the kids reaction I wouldn't mind paying a little more for quality.  I doubt this will survive long"
"1948","1","This has to be worst thing I've ever purchased Amazon. I bought this for my one year olds birthday. It's supposed to be waterproof, it's not. After two uses it is now rusting and will not work. It was not caused by user error  when we put the batteries in it we made sure that it was put back together properly. Don't waste your money on this."
"1949","1","I bought this to give as a gift, it doesn<U+2019>t even come in a box. It<U+2019>s extremely small. I<U+2019>m very disappointed I won<U+2019>t be giving this as a gift. I haven<U+2019>t even put in batteries to see if it works. Waste of money"
"1950","4","Needs a better instruction manual."
"1951","5","Grandkids love this thing."
"1952","1","NEVER WORKED. PLEASE SEND NEW ONE. CHEAP."
"1953","1","Very tiny was really disappointed  should have sent it back"
"1954","1","Stopped working after just a few uses..."
"1955","5","Grandson loves it!"
"1956","3","Nothing special. Doesn't stay lit very long, burns out batteries quickly. Water got inside too (arrived broken I think). It's okay."
"1957","2","It is NOT WATERPROOF. And the suction cup doesn<U+2019>t work.Other then that my kids love it.If someone fixes these design flaws it would be a massive success!!!....even better if they make it smaller & like a fidget spinner!"
"1958","4","I bought it for my 1 year old Grandson Mars and now my Granddaughter Linnea Rain wants one! They should make them rechargeable"
"1959","1","Don't waste your money. It says it uses AA on the product. It doesn't, it's AAA. My son got to enjoy this 2 bath times before the product developed a mind of its own. Idk if it was from water getting in (supposedly water CANT) or how it's made. It would not turn off and stay off. I would wake up to the lights on in the middle of the night, or i would turn it off and before I got my son in his towel it would already be back on. Eventually, it wouldn't even turn off. I removed the batteries and threw it in the trash."
"1960","2","Our 1 year old used it in the tub once before the batteries went dead and water got inside (even though we tightened it as securely as we could)."
"1961","2","Broke within a week :("
"1962","2","Cute toy! Our daughter loved it both in and out of the bathtub.  However, within 2 weeks of use the insides started to corrode and we had to toss it."
"1963","1","It is not waterproof and is dangerous!!"
"1964","1","I followed the instructions and sealed the battery compartment as tight as it could go, but within five minutes of it being in the tub it already had water leaking into the batteries and then wouldn't turn it off."
"1965","2","Much smaller than it appears in pic"
"1966","1","Toy plastic broke within minutes iodnmy kid having it so I had to take it away so he would cut himself."
"1967","1","I was so excited to get this for my daughter for bath time. I opened it as soon as it arrived and to much disappointment it didn<U+2019>t work I followed the instructions and put the batteries in correctly it just wouldn<U+2019>t ever come on. I<U+2019>ll be returning it and looking else where."
"1968","3","Very beautiful and your baby might like it much. But it is really fragile. This toy is just thin plastic so you have to be careful when you change battery"
"1969","1","Broke as soon as we opened it."
"1970","1","Lasted 2 days. My kids liked to submerge it which made it fill with water and batteries are now wet and corroding. There are 2 holes built into it so looks like it should be ok as long as not held under water."
"1971","1","Junk"
"1972","1","This item was used for my child to play with in the tub.. It didnt last 3 baths before it stopped working.. do not waste your money on this item.  It is too expenisve for this very very little product."
"1973","1","Wasn't at all what I expected for a birthday gift for my grandson. Would not buy another for aure."
"1974","1","it is not water proof. water leaks inside were is batteries and cords located :(in general is cool idea, looks great, but unfortunately after first use needed to dissemble to get water out of it."
"1975","2","I guess I was a bit surprised with the picture. I thought there were multiple toys in this package, but there were only one. About the size of a large biscuit. Don<U+2019>t think I would have paid this much for this small toy."
"1976","1","Garbage.  Broke after 1 use.  Absolutely ridiculous. Shredding my money would have been less infuriating."
"1977","1","Received and used it on Tuesday. Followed introductions to the fullest. It<U+2019>s Friday and the item no longer works. Changed barriers three times and no use. You get what you paid for I guess."
"1978","1","My husband put this toy together per instructions and it immediately started leaking water and ruined the light up toy."
"1979","1","Water got in it the first time we used it. We sent it back. DON""T buy this. Waste of money and time."
"1980","1","It leaked during the first bath."
"1981","1","This product, as I should have known, lasted after only one tubby time. The item got water inside from the cheap construction and malfunctioned. Unless I received a faulty item, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
"1982","1","This is the worst bath toy ever. Broke the second day. Also the picture is deceiving as the child is playing with multiple toys in the bath and you only get one cheap circular ball. I<U+2019>d give it zero stars if I could."
"1983","1","Please do not buy this for your child. Bought and it didnt work so took it apart and the wires inside were exposed and really hot. If it had been placed in the tub with child, it could have severely hurt the child. STAY AWAY"
"1984","5","good"
"1985","1","This thing is not waterproof, its ruined the second day. The tiny screws will stripped if you try to tighten it. Why they said this is bath toy, its not. Dont waste your money"
"1986","1","I was so excited when I Received it but when I looked at it, I Received a broken one! Upset!"
"1987","1","toy is not water safe.  Two minutes into bathtime and it was filled with water."
"1988","1","This product is not waterproof and needs batteries. Completely unsafe for water use OR children. Total scam."
"1989","1","I put the batteries in and it didn't work. Currently in the return process."
"1990","1","I honestly don't even know what this is. It's nothing like the picture and looks so janky."
"1991","1","Is not a waterproof toy, I am returning"
"1992","1","It was broken when I got so I never got to use it for my son, it did not come with batteries either"
"1993","1","Please don<U+2019>t buy this item.. This came in just a crap cover and not even working as shown in the picture . Please don<U+2019>t buy it."
"1994","1","First use this filled with water."
"1995","1","Suppose to be a bath toy so when we put it in water (making sure it was sealed up tight) we were kinda disappointed when it stopped working after one bath"
"1996","3","The kids thought it was fun. Water did get into the toy so I don<U+2019>t think it will last very long."
"1997","1","Water gets in the toy and can only be used a few times."
"1998","1","It's very small and you only get one. Not worth 15 bucks. Sending back. Not even in a box. It was going to be a gift. Picture is very deceiving"
"1999","1","Water gets inside and makes batteries leak. Not safe and should not sell for kids. I would like my money refunded"
"2000","1","Arrived broken"
"2001","1","Very disappointed in this purchase! My granddaughter took one bath with this toy, we hung it to dry and it never worked again."
"2002","1","Stopped working after 2 baths.  Changed batteries and everything and it<U+2019>s done for already."
"2003","1","Used once and it stopped working and is badly rusted inside.  What a waste of money!"
"2004","1","Just got it in today and was really looking forward to bath time tonight with my baby but it doesn<U+2019>t even work. Put brand new batteries in and all."
"2005","1","If there was a -1star is what they would get. Water gens inside. Despite the package being loose inside the item was scratched and chipped. I carefully placed the batteries inside in hopes that it would all be as advertised but it just filled with water inside.Waste of money.What I don<U+2019>t understand is why this is Amazon<U+2019>s choice and how they have do many positive reviews but after reading a few I realize some aren<U+2019>t even related to the item listed. Go check it out yourself.FAKE REVIEWS!!!! Don<U+2019>t buy."
"2006","1","Used once and my nephew loved it, until it filled with water and the battery rusted and turned water brown.. waste of money and very disappointed child"
"2007","1","Kids were not too impressed with this toy. Plus we were really afraid of using the batteries in the water."
"2008","1","isn't waterproof"
"2009","1","Does not seal against water! Was really cool to use 3 times and then it was having issues as it just filled up with water."
"2010","2","It lasts for 3 days only.. we cant turn it off after 3 days ..<U+0001F622>"
"2011","1","Lights up well for maybe 2 seconds then goes super dim. Definitely not as advertised."
"2012","1","Picture is deceiving. After placing batteries in, water got into toy and it is ruined. Doesn<U+2019>t work. Garbage toy."
"2013","1","This product was not waterproof. So it malfunctioned. I barely had it a month."
"2014","1","Photo shows a few of these floats not just a single one. This item could have been a lot better."
"2015","1","i don't like it its broken . the light isnt working what happen i need change"
"2016","1","Have not put batteries in and tested yet but feels very cheap! Don<U+2019>t think it<U+2019>s worth $15 for sure. I will be returning"
"2017","1","Doesn't work I returned to him.<U+0001F44E><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F44E><U+0001F3FB>"
"2018","1","This worked 1 time in the bath and then water leaked inside and ruined it."
"2019","1","Very disappointing!! My son was only able to use one time as water got in it. Definitely not waterproof!! Would not buy!!"
"2020","1","Did not work.  Tried two sets of batteries."
"2021","1","Broke after one use! Won<U+2019>t stay lit up. Don<U+2019>t buy! Not waterproof as described, which defeats the purpose."
"2022","2","Arrived cracked by screw hole. It appears someone overtightened it and broke it."
"2023","1","Don't waste your time and money. Broken switch. Poorly made."
"2024","1","Not as advertised. It is tiny and collects water. Not good for the bath."
"2025","1","only worked a month before I had to throw it away"
"2026","1","Item received as gift. When we went to put batteries in this piece was broken."
"2027","1","Lasted one use until water got in and it no longer lights up."
"2028","1","Broken, cracked. Could not use at all and much smaller in real life"
"2029","1","Came cracked and collects water."
"2030","1","Was very small and not at all what I expected.  Very disappointed"
"2031","1","Do not buy it is not waterproof."
"2032","1","Got water in it after the first use. Shorted out after second use."
"2033","1","the toy broke after one bath. waste of money"
"2034","1","Mine doesn't light up"
"2035","1","Doesn<U+2019>t work don<U+2019>t buy"
"2036","1","This broke the first time we used it."
"2037","1","Very small disappointed in it."
"2038","1","Don<U+2019>t buy doesn<U+2019>t work !"
"2039","1","I am not sure where all these five star ratings came from, that led me to purchase they toy. One, it does not look waterproof at all, that being said I put batteries in and it does not work. The only other verified purchase in the comment section is from the other 1 star rating. Cheaply made and overpriced. I do most of my ordering on Amazon, but am finding an increased amount of sub-par products, and may be switching to a different online realtor if the issue persists. And to add insult to injury, apparently the item is not eligible for return."
"2040","2","We were surprised at how small the toy was, but once it was in hands of our little grandson, it was perfect. He splashed in the tub with it nonstop for about 10 minutes - until it quit working! We had triple-checked the screws after we installed the batteries, and made sure everything was tight. I don't know if the toddker hit it too hard on the tub and cracked it a bit or not (we couldn't find one), but there was a bit of water inside. Will probably stick to colored plastic tubby toys and bubble bath from now on."
"2041","1","Arrived cracked and broken.  Whatever this plastic is made out of it's very brittle.  Also why does it need 3 batteries to run some LED lights?"
"2042","3","Gifted to grandson but parents are just as enamored and love the ambience it creates. I think I bought 4 or 5 of them because I reordered for other grandchildren. Whatever you do, don't open it up without putting batteries in before it gets wet. We ruined the first one not realizing this. My daughter just told me that the one I gave her died because it got water inside (when cared for properly) she even glued it trying to keep it dry inside. She thinks it might have gotten in through the switch. If this product could stay dry inside at least until batteries died, I would give it a 5 star rating."
"2043","1","Plastic would not close and seal up after opening to add batteries, so we could not use it in the tub."
"2044","1","very small screw to try to open to put battery. Don't buy it."
"2045","1","Junk. Well not assemble correctly."
"2046","1","I am sending this back pronto.  Don<U+2019>t waste a thought that this might be a fun toy!!  It<U+2019>s not worth the struggle to find the itty bitty screw driver to remove the back to install the batteries. No stars would be my choice."
"2047","1","This is a horrible product. Shouldn<U+2019>t even be offered by amazon. It is faulty and cheap. Do NOT buy it. Waste of money."
"2048","2","smaller than I thought"
"2049","2","It was awesome at first. My little boy loved it. But he only got to use it for like 5 baths because water got inside and it stopped working"
"2050","2","Way smaller than I thought."
"2051","1","We received this as a gift, however, it allowed water in on the very first use.With a battery, that is not safe at all.I wouldn't recommend buying this for bath time."
"2052","1","This toy was not waterproof. It filled with water on first use. Very disappointed, do not recommend. After looking closer, I realized many of the reviews for this item were not actually for this product, but some copied and pasted to boost ratings."
"2053","4","Hopefully no one will see this part of the description.<U+23F3> SAVES YOUR PRECIOUS TIME. Using this tub toy you can make your 1-5 year old kid have fun by himself in a bath while you<U+2019>re enjoying time for yourself."
"2054","1","Most of these reviews do not pertain to this lighted toy!"
"2055","1","not worth the 15 bucks I paid for and worst is you can get it for 3 bucks on wishthe side of the toy cracked when unscrewing, I didn't even attempt to put it in the water.But yes I will say it is very bright and colorful and  my son liked it out of the water."
"2056","1","Water gets inside immediately, totally not worth the price , I had to take mine apart and fix for it work , right out of the box. Push botton to turn on was not properly installed , cheap device , cheaply made"
"2057","2","Small and looks cheap.  Plus you need 3 batteries.  Overpriced"
"2058","1","I wish I could give it zero stars! Never worked from the first day. Water accumulates inside and the inside rusts turning the water brown. It's a piece of garbage."
"2059","1","Not what I expected. Way over priced. Includes only one toy not all shown in picture."
"2060","1","This worked one time and then water got in to the battery cavity."
"2061","1","The toy was great at first but leaked battery acid all through my nephews bathtub while he was in it! Wouldn<U+2019>t suggest this toy."
"2062","1","This toy only worked for about a week. Water got inside the toy and killed it. The toy barely stuck to the tub. Worst toy I ever brought."
"2063","3","cool light/toy for my sons bath but I was pretty irritated with the fact that 1 light is 16 dollars where I was led to believe you get two in a box, from the products site.. Every picture they show and descriptions shows more than one light and in the description they describe everything in plural form making it appear you get a set of two lights. So don't be fooled you get ONE light for 16 dollars. I find that way to high  of a price and am upset that  they are false advertising the product. Should be 2 lights at least for 16 bucks or  show people you only get one freaking light!"
"2064","5","My son loves it!!!<U+0001F601>"
"2065","1","I would give it 0 stard if I could!I bought this for my grand daughter's birthday. It arrived and has never worked!"
"2066","1","Stopped working after the first use."
"2067","2","Product came cracked on the outer layer and not the protective layer that houses the batteries. I noticed it once the batteries were in and I was setting the screws. My son was already intrigued so I went ahead and gave it a go but I don<U+2019>t expect this product to last long. I bought it as a bath toy and I suspect water will find its way in an ultimately damage the toy. We<U+2019>ll enjoy it while it lasts but I will not be purchasing another or recommending this"
"2068","1","To begin, if you search Amazon longer than I did , you'll find the exact same product for a variety of different prices. The lowest being ~ $4. Now as I'm impulsive I could have easily moved forward,  and looked past my over spending on the item, if it had worked for more than ONE USE. Opened the item as directed,  inserted batteries as directed,  closed as directed. First use in the tub the battery enclosure was filled with water. Suctioning it to the side of the tub after use in hopes of draining it the same way the water somehow achieved entry. Over night the batteries oxidized and rusted and actually did drip out.... slighly. Just enough to stain my tub. If you want this exact product,  I would suggest using a whole tube of clear silicone caulk around the factory seal."
"2069","1","I bought this for a gift. When I received it, it was much smaller than I expected. (About as big as my hand). I was too embarrassed to give it as a gift. I kept it, thinking I would let my grandson use it when he came to visit. It had a short and would come on and off randomly. You had to hit it on the table to make it turn on and off. I was too afraid to put it in the water with my grandson. Since it had a short, I couldn<U+2019>t take any chances on its safety. This is not a product I would recommend."
"2070","1","<U+00A0>This is a piece of crap!!  Water immediately got inside the device near the battery compartment.  This is unsafe for children. All you see are the batteries. The photos in the advertisement are very misleading and cleverly conceal the fact that all you see are batteries. So cheaply made that when I went to take out the batteries the screws became stripped.  I don<U+2019>t know where all the great reviews came from, possibly everyone in the small town in China where this is manufactured wrote a good review."
"2071","1","This device has been nothing but a hassle... The setup process is alright if you're the least bit tech savvy. The monitor was fine for a month or two, but then it began to have issues charging. At first we had to replace the charging cable. Then, as with many micro USB ports, it stopped charging altogether. I thought it might be the battery, as I know the BF6X battery is replaceable. I opened the monitor and the charging port literally just fell out. It was secured to the board by nothing more than the five electrical connections themselves. PISS POOR CONSTRUCTION. We now have no monitor... That's not all.The online portion of the camera is, to be as nice as possible, completely unreliable. The camera has line-of-sight access to our 110/10 internet connection, but we can never keep a reliable video stream on any of our devices. It will almost always tell us that there is an issue with ""Low Bandwidth"", even when our phones or tablets are on the same subnet! Now we have no monitor AND we have no reliable way of accessing the $300 camera.This is the second Motorola camera & monitor package that we've had fail on us in two years. I'm never buying Motorola again."
"2072","1","** CAMERA STARTED TO CATCH FIRE!!! Details At the End **CAMERA IS NOT AS ADVERTISED - NO HD video, NO 720, NO IR AS PROMISEDBottom Line Upfront: Read the reviews, older cameras worked great because they were made in a different factory then the ones sold now.  The older Cameras with a VT1411 in the beginning of their serial numbers are from before Motorola KNOWINGLY AND INTENTIONALLY ""downgraded"" the cameras while continuing to sell them as if they were the Older version.Got this FROM MOTOROLA after I returned the 8th replacement attempt and sent them the attached video comparison... as pictures show you everything...""The older cameras had a higher drive level to the IR LED<U+2019>s and in turn do not have the range of the newer cameras that you have. I tested the cameras that you returned and get results similar to what you provided.""And then there was nothing further as to what Motorola was going to do to fix the problem.Motorola should be sued for Fraud. They advertise this as having ""8 Infrared (IR) LED Emitters"" - this is false.  The factory in CHINA (you know where this is going) that they are using has a known history in the CCTV industry (I should know, I'm in that industry) of having over a 60% defect rate in their production... so why does Motorola use them??? Because they are the rock bottom cheapest.In the attached pictures you can see what 8 IR emitters looks like with Cameras 1 and 2. Cameras 5-8 when I finally started documenting this, the IR LEDS are not even working or are not even in the unit (CHINA MANUFACTURING IS KNOWN FOR FRAUD - and apparently proud of it). Using an IR meter, with cameras 5-8, the best I ever recorded on IR illumination was 40% of what Cameras 1 and 2 put out. As evidenced from the email line above, they know this.This product is bad... and getting worse every day.  Sort the reviews in order of most recent... it becomes very evident that Motorola is imploding.The Full Story (Will Be Updated as Things Continue)- Got this as a gift for my son's birthday July 2015- From the first day, the Hubbleconnected website only worked about 50% of the time...at best.- By December I was having to reset the cameras every day; By February several times a day- By March the portable monitor was superimposing all of my cameras on top of each other- By April the portable monitor failed totally and my cameras would having issues STOPPING panning and tilting during aimingAPRIL 25th... replacement display and monitor from Motorola. Refurb on the display... 2x new cameras- Both ""new cameras"" had their IR emitters dead out of the box. Glad I did not send my old ones in - even though they were auto-panning at times, at least I could see my son in the dark- The monitor appears to work... will let you know how the requested THIRD set goes.MAY 1... THIRD set of cameras arrives- Once again, both cameras were junk out of the box.  Either the IR emitters are bad... or just not there.  Which would not surprise me given its made in China which is known for shoddy workmanship and charging companies for things they never do or never put in.- Once again, Motorola is sending me a set of cameras... this will be attempt #4!MAY 21... FOURTH set of cameras (Camera 7 & 8)- Once again, junk out of the box.- Each camera took over 10 attempts to pair- Each camera failed IR test.  I am convinced that Motorola has just stopped putting IR in the cameras or is KNOWINGLY putting less than 8 IR LEDS in the camera... since they are aware of the problems with the cameras... and still do nothing... they are responsible.- Will be sending back and getting cameras 9 and 10.JUNE 16, 2016- Motorola is REFUSING to send me anymore cameras and admitted that the new cameras do not have the same resolution or night vision IR as the old ones and therefore will never be able to get me a replacement of ""the same or better quality"" which is violation of US LAW under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act AND the Fair Business Act.SEPTEMBER 12, 2016New Cameras 9 & 10 were sent out having been made, supposedly to different specs and date stamped from June 2016.  IR was almost back to the quality of the 2014 cameras... not as good, but better picture quality under low light... so the trade off is acceptable.JANUARY 23, 2017Camera 9 started to have issues with its color switching between color and black & white.  When coming up from black & white it would come up with a yellow tint image or a blue tint image... it would sometimes go full color. Then it started to power cycle itself. By the time i got on a ladder it was hot to the touch and smelling of burning electrics.Like I said before, shoddy workmanship and poor quality. This will get a child and their family hurt.  Just imagine what could have happened if this camera which was over my son<U+2019>s crib, caught fire while he was sleeping and feel into his crib, trapping him as it set fire to his blankets.  Not good, Motorola/Binatone<U+2026> not good at all.FEB 2, 2017Replacement camera #11 arrived - on the same day that Camera #10's imager failed just like the other one.  Instead of waiting for it to start to smoke, I just pulled it and set it aside... now waiting on Replacement #12 in less than two years."
"2073","3","We were looking for a camera to replace our Summer Infant Peek Plus monitor that was on it's way out the door.  Currently our monitor had a LCD screen and used WIFI for mobile viewing.  So we picked up the Motorola and decided to give it a chance.First Issue.  PAIN TO UPDATEIt took me quite a while to get the camera to communicate to update the firmware.  We wanted to make sure the firmware updated due to the beeping that the unit does with the stock firmware.  Who wants a beeping monitor in a sleeping child's room?  Whoever designed that was not a parent...  So updating the firmware (so i had previously read in reviews) would take care of this issue.  About an hour late and multiple attempts I was able to update the firmware and set the camera up.Second isue: NIGHT VISION IS POORThere is 2 problems with the night vision on this camera.1) Night vision is very dark.  If you compare this to my sold Summer Infant Peek Plus the old Peek Plus wins HANDS DOWN.  The Motorola camera is easily twice as dark than that of the Peek Plus, and the Peak Plus is OLD Technology.  This alone may be the reason NOT to buy this unit.  The night vision on this camera needs a vast improvement.  After using it for only a few days we may want to return this unit simply due to it being too dark.2) When in ""Auto"" mode the camera switches to night vision too easily.  My child's room can be fully lit and none the less the camera switches to night vision.  I am not sure where the photosensor is located on the unit to detect light, but it sure does not work properly.  Due to this the camera is virtually always in Night Vision mode even when the lights are on.Third Issue:  LOW QUALITY IMAGE ON HANDHELD, LESS FEATURESHaving a handheld unit and Wifi built in on a single unit is a nice feature, but with this model you will quickly notice that when using the Hubble App and the Handheld unit you will notice at least 2 things.1) The Image quality is very low on the handheld when compared to the Hubble App2) Many of the camera features cannot be changed on the handheld, only with the Hubble App.  So if you dont plan on using the WIFI, you cannot change many features.  Be warned.First Pro:  THE UNIT WORKSIssues aside the unit does at least work.  I know, it should work, after all that's why you bought it!  But you will be able to use your wifi and the handheld to view the camera and the pan and tilt work.  You will be able to see the temp in the room and several other features that all do work fairly well once you get the thing up and running.All in all if you are expecting a high quality image, this unit will disappoint you.  Otherwise it does work, but dont expect the world."
"2074","1","We have 2 cameras and 1 monitor, the system worked well for several months but now will not sustain connection between the monitor and cameras. We have tried everything with no luck. We can move 1 of the cameras the monitor but the monitor will not show the video feed. The other camera will not connect with the monitor at all...sparatically we will get noise but no video, or movement."
"2075","1","The overall objective of the monitor ups to listen to when your baby is crying. This product fails to pick up sound terribly. The extra bucks you pay for the wifi conection and be able to see online is just not worth it. The app to see the camara is horrible and does not function properly. I would recommend you go with something more traditional.I have used this for one night and one day. Have had to pair the Device 4 times. I am purchasing something else."
"2076","1","I've been using these monitors for my twins for the last 14 months. They have been nothing short of frustrating and exhausting. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone. I read reviews before buying, and knew I was taking a chance. I had issues nearly from day one. The handheld parent unit died within the first 2 months of using it. I couldn't get a replacement from the company, because I never had time to do the ridiculous amount of troubleshooting and resets that they wanted me to do with my entire camera system, while trying to take care of 2 month old twins with reflux. So I gave up requesting a replacement, and used iPads that I owned to view the monitors separately. For the past year I have been juggling two iPads to watch my kids while they sleep, but that's the least frustrating part.The cameras always go offline. Always always always. I have removed and re-added the cameras so many times, I lost track a long time sago. They sometimes go offline multiple times a day, sometimes for days at a time.There is a TERRIBLE delay in sound AND video. There's at least a two second sound delay, and anywhere from 2 second to TEN MINUTE video delay. HOW is that helpful?!I wanted so badly to love these cameras, but they are just awful. Don't waste your money, they're an expensive waste. <U+0001F614>"
"2077","1","This camera constantly disconnects and needs to be reset. Resetting isn't as simple as pushing a button. I also have the newer version and really haven't had any issues. The video really confuses me as sometimes it looks like something is on the camera lens. The overall movement is limited as well. Bottom line is if you're going to spend the money for this camera I would like elsewhere. This model is so unreliable and extremely frustrating."
"2078","1","This is the biggest piece of garbage a complete waste of money! The camera stopped syncing to the monitor I had to constantly pair it to the monitor! Plus the monitor volume began to weaken. Finally I just took the thing and broke it and threw it out!!! Save your money don't buy it!!"
"2079","1","We got this camera to replace a previous Motorola model we had that we broke the charging port on. We decided to go the wifi route to use our phones as well. Wow are these cameras bad!  You can barely make out anything in the dark. The night mode on our last cameras was great and now it's almost useless. Also the delay between the parent unit and the camera is at least a fill second behind. The older model was about instant. The last issue I have is the sound quality on the parent unit now is the worst I have ever had. When there is s loud noise ""like a baby crying"" it comes through as horrible distortion!  So disappointed in the waste of money on another Motorola product."
"2080","5","Have had the device for almost a year now and I can say it's very convenient.The included RF (radio frequency) monitor is easy to use and connects instantaneously after setup and I have yet to go anywhere in or around my three story brick house that is out of range.I also heavily use the app on multiple android devices.  There is a 5-10 second delay as it connects via WiFi or as much as 20 seconds if remote like at work.  The app notifications are good, I use motion only (not noise) as I have two very barky dogs!  I find the app extremely helpful if I am in another room and didn't bring the included monitor with me (it has a good battery length though).  I also like the app as on Android (not sure iOS) you can leave it open and multitask and still hear the audio.People have mentioned the delay in moving the camera remotely but I find I almost never do that once it was set up.  There is also a delay with the ""Talkback"" feature, but again not something I use super heavily and I can wait 5-10 seconds.The other in app features I use include taking pictures (to send to the grandparents) and checking the temperature as the baby's room tends to be quite different from the rest of our house.The rest of the Motorola Hubble ecosystem didn't come out until after we had our baby and other products or I would have likely purchase other app compatible products."
"2081","1","Seeing mix reviews for various baby monitors, and having cross-tested several top runners ourselves, we paid a premium for this MBP843CONNECT due to the Motorola name... BIGGEST MISTAKE!Setup is similar to other monitors, the camera response and infrared vision is less laggy compared to the other ones we tested, those are the good part.HOWEVER, just after 4 months of usage, the monitor stopped syncing up with our mobile devices (via Hubble), even after resetting it multiple times.Ok, so we will rely on the 4.3-in LCD monitor, NOT! That LCD monitor stopped working and won't turn on after just 1 month of usage!!Basically this system is useless after just 5 months of use, and now I have to see if Motorola will provide a warranty for this product.Do not recommend this."
"2082","1","Ugh, I<U+2019>ve two other Motorola monitors and they<U+2019>ve been great, not sure what happened with this one. Wishing I had gone by the Amazon reviews and not other sites. Our most recent Motorola monitor was the 36s so that<U+2019>s what I<U+2019>m comparing.I only have cons for this:1. The night vision is HORRIBLE. Camera is in the same place as the old one and I can barely see my kid. The 36s wasn<U+2019>t great, it<U+2019>s grainy but I least I could see her.2. When the monitor is on but the screen is off there is a 15-20 lag for the screen to turn back on. Not great for the middle of the night when you<U+2019>re trying to see if your kid is crying because she<U+2019>s awake or because something is wrong. May not seem like a long time but it sure is when your kid is screaming. I could run down to her room faster than the screen turns on.3. Tilting and panning also has a lag, press the button, nothing happens. Hold it down and it will finally start to move but then not stop when you let go of the button.4. Could not get the WiFi to connect to use the app. Tried for HOURS and kept getting an error message.5. This I could have lived with, but with everything else it sort of sent me over the edge - both power cords for the camera and parent unit have this huge bulky thing attached near the end. So it kept pulling the parent unit off the table if I didn<U+2019>t make sure the bulky weighted portion was sitting fully on the table. How annoying.I<U+2019>ve had a really good experience with our other Motorola monitors so I<U+2019>m pretty surprised how bad this monitor is."
"2083","3","I wanted to love this as much as we loved our previous Motorola monitor. I do not. When our previous model starting wearing out, we looked into the new ones, and went with this for the cell phone option. I walk about a block down to pick up my oldest from the bus, and sometimes the baby would still be napping. This seemed ideal. But we have so many issues with it losing signal. It has to be way too close to get a good image, which doesn't work with the cord. Panning has a delay, and then goes too far. It's just not nearly as good as the prior model. It does, however, work at the bus stop, so I won't replace it yet."
"2084","1","Bought this for the dual use of monitor screen while home and wifi connection via smartphone while away from home. Horrible. Night vision is terrible especially compared to previous motorola cameras I have used as well as other brands. I can't tell if my baby is even in the crib half the time nor can I hear her unless I have the monitor cranked up on volume and put the thing to my ear. Not at all a helpful baby monitor if you want to see where/if a baby climbs out of the crib. Unless my baby is screaming crying, I can't hear her either. Very disappointed in Motorola, a company whose previous products I have liked. I will be looking for another wifi capable camera and monitor combo."
"2085","1","I would not recommend this product to anyone. It was the worst monitor and we have used Motorola in the past and were loyol customers until we bought this. It would do firmware updates in the middle of the night and would beep and wake us up. It was waking us up more them our children were. The volume wasn't good it was very fant and at night we have a fan on in our room and couldn't hear the monitor. We must not have very good internet connection because every night we would loose connection and there for couldn't see or hear our children. The last straw was when I found my son had been up crying for a very long time one night and come to find out he had 103 temp and phenonia.  We returned it and happy to do so. The only positive is the monitor has a great picture."
"2086","1","As others have written, there appear to be a lot of lemons out there.Attracted by the dual 2.4gHz and wifi connectivity, I decided this was worth the splurge (replacing an older Motorola monitor which we managed to lose). I have relatively low expectations/needs for a monitor. I don't need amazing image quality and a couple seconds delay is no big deal. But we've had nothing but problems with this monitor and finally bought a new one (non-Motorola) within 5 months.The WiFi feature is useless because the app is so buggy, and admittedly so by Motorola's customer service. It was alerting my phone constantly of noise or motion when no one was in the room. So we had to turn off that feature.  So much for remote viewing.And the mic was inconsistent. We'd wake up to the sound of our 2 year old screaming his head off. We can't hear it on the monitor, but we can hear it up 1.5 flights of stairs."
"2087","1","Sick of this unit.  Drops out every night around 3-6am.  The internet fails all the time, and I have mesh google WiFi with a puck super close to the cameras.  The entire system is just bad.  Oh and when you call to get it replaced, Binatone, the company who does support will make you go through dozens of steps to get it fixed.  It<U+2019>s a joke.  Never buy a Motorola baby monitor.  We switched to Infant Optics and it<U+2019>s perfect."
"2088","1","Returned. Bought to replace old Motorola that I really liked and used when caregiver for terminal sister. It died, and wanted new one for watching new puppy. Given my prior positive experience with my Motorola monitor and the company reputation, I didn<U+2019>t do much research. Only after receiving and researching the problems I was having did I discover MANY having same problems. Monitor constantly going offline and, when using smartphone app away from home...forget it. Lousy connectivity. If you check the Motorala app in Apple store, you will see the SAME complaints going back years, with the developer saying how much it appreciates feedback to help improve the product. But they obviously haven<U+2019>t despite repeated complaints. And Motorola<U+2019>s response when I contacted them about it was <U+201C>That<U+2019>s a third-party Seller and we have no control over it.<U+201D> So why do they keep marketing the app with their products??! Motorola no longer on my list of trusted manufacturers."
"2089","2","Got this for our 2nd child. After countless hours researching this was 1 of final 5 that I purchased to ultimately keep 1... well, none of them overly impressed me, but this was the one I disliked least and ultimately the ability to use phone app won out.So what about that awesome dual mode feature? It quickly became clear that wasn't much of an upside, for one you have the app open/foreground which kind of renders the device otherwise useless while wanting to truly monitor... and worse any time your WiFi loses connection even at all the app/camera forget about each other and you have to go through the whole pairing process again (which you usually find out about when you need to use it and cannot do the pairing).The dedicated monitor is ok. One annoyance is almost every time I power it on it beeps loudly and says no camera found for a few seconds before finding it. Another annoyance is while you can set it to turn the screen off after X minutes, there is no way to do the same for audio i.e. unlike my first child's crappy monitor this one has no audio activation and always has the speaker activated on the monitor.And now, just 6 months after the original purchase, the speaker on the monitor has crapped out (my theory is because of aforementioned fact the speaker never stops).  So I have a dual mode monitor where the mobile app mode is highly unreliable and dedicated monitor without a speaker.  I'll likely have to supplement with an audio-only monitor now."
"2090","1","I do not recommend this monitor. After about 8 months of daily use, the power connection to the parent unit began to wear out, causing the power adapter to fit into the parent unit loosely instead of tight. The cord then had to be situated <U+201C>just so<U+201D> or it wouldn<U+2019>t charge.  In the middle of the night the battery alert would go off, because of the poor power connection.  It is very dissapointing, because otherwise, the monitor is great (clear video & sound, great remote pan/tilt, steady video/parent unit connection). When mine began to fail, it was under the 1 year warranty, but too late to return. I went through Binatone for the replacement parts per the user manual. I recieved a new parent unit, but I am still waiting for a new cord as of 4 months later! I had to buy a new monitor in the meantime. Unfortunately, because I thought the cord was a fluke and loved the monitor otherwise, bought a newer model Motorola... I had the same power cord connection issues after 3 months with the newer model! I will be shopping for a new monitor in a new brand, that uses AC type cord ends and ports, not the mini USB type.  These monitors are not worth the price if only surviving months. I would rate this zero if I could."
"2091","3","Less than 8mo after having it, the video on the parent  unit stopped working. I had sound but no matter what i did, the video would not come on. i even hooked up the camera to another (yet same) monitor and it worked. so its not the camera. I do love that i can pan and tilt from the parent unit. My baby girl moves around in her crib while she sleeps so its nice to move the camera to see her.Another issue i have is the connection between the parent and baby unit sometimes go out. The volume isnt very loud also. When i watch her through my phone its much better; when the signal strength isn't too weak.Set up is very easy. In fact it is done for you when both plugged in."
"2092","2","I really really really want this moniter to work-I want it to be everything it says it is-bc that's the perfect moniter!I LOVE:-the 2 cameras with split screen or alternating screens-the handheld moniter AND the app-the tilt & turn by remote-the picture taking and the video optionI DONT Love:-how loose the chord connectionto that is<U+0001F621> It's always falling out and the moniter dies. Very annoying-sometimes the camera has a bad connection and starts beeping very loudly. I guess it's s good thing but I wish the volume were relative to that volume setting for hearing the kids. Even with the volume off it beeps insanely loud waking up everyone. I'm awake often enough with twins. I don't need other things waking me up.-it's just glichy. My husband is always having to reset it and stuff.Basically it just needs to work better-I do still use it every night, I would buy it again, I'd even recommend it as long as you can handle glitches, etc."
"2093","1","This monitor was okay at first. Setup was fairly easy and the quality was decent. The battery life on the parent unit could be a little better, but it lasts most of the day. Shortly after we hooked it up a firmware update was issued that seriously degraded the quality of the night vision video. We also experienced issues with the audio cutting out for a few seconds at a time. The manufacturer says an update is forthcoming that will address the video quality issue, but it has been at least two months and no update (you can check in the app).We contacted Binatone support (no, this isn<U+2019>t actually a Motorola product, the name has been licensed), which is a headache in itself, and we were told we needed a new parent unit. We are now on our third parent unit, which keeps shutting off randomly, and they are now sending us a new baby unit.I am hoping that with the new baby unit and by going back to one of the first two parent units maybe I will get a functioning system. All the while my wife is completely paranoid she will sleep through the baby crying or something else will happen from not seeing or hearing the baby during naps or at night.Do yourself a favor, skip the Motorola baby monitors completely. Nothing is worth the headache, frustration, and loss of sleep this thing has caused. Dealing with the manufacturer (again, not Motorola) is a pain, and they clearly don<U+2019>t train their employees well enough to troubleshoot these issues properly."
"2094","1","My baby is 5.5 months old and the camera and monitor are pretty much toast. The monitor won't charge anymore unless you have the charger set up just right, and the camera won't work at all unless plugged into the charger, which may or may not be part of the design, but it's annoying. The charger is also loose on the camera now and falls out in the middle of the night and makes a loud beeping alert noise. The camera also has fits where it won't rotate now and then, so I'm thinking that's the next feature to go. Pretty bummed it's taken a dive already. I have to go get a new one. The warranty isn't easy to work with either, so I'm not sure I want a new one even if it goes through. I figured I just got a faulty device; however, my friend got the same monitor and her baby is 8 months old and it's also doing the same thing, and she purchased from BuyBuyBaby. I will say the Hubble feature where you can watch from you phone/iPad was very nice! I gave my mom the access code so she could ""babysit"" while I took a shower or something. We live far away so she loved being able to peek in on him from time to time. Unfortunately, I do not recommend this product."
"2095","2","So, you can log in on phones and on a desktop to view the monitor. This seems cool, but in reality you aren't going to use it. Odds of the baby being in the crib or any one place when you want to log in is unlikely, so it's kinda a waste. Also it doesn't capture motion well, and with our son being a wiggle-worm i can't see his face sometimes well enough to tell if he is laughing in his crib or crying. It also has a 2-way communication from the monitor, but it sucks - there is a delay on when it starts sending your voice, so words get cut off when you start talking, and while you are talking you can't hear what is going on in the room.Additionally, the monitor locks when it has not been in use for a while, which also seems cool, but when you are half asleep at 4 in the morning, and you're trying to find the ""unlock"" button in the dark (buttons are not backlit) just so that you can hit the other button to turn the actual monitor screen off (leaving the sounds on), it's a serious irritation.There were some great intentions from the team that designed it, but it's feels like it was designed by someone who has never actually had a child."
"2096","2","One of the things I liked about this camera was that if there was any motion in the crib it would send me a notification.If I left my baby sleeping in the care of loved ones to run a quick errand I would be notified once he woke up. Well after a couple of months I started getting notifications even though my baby wasn't in his crib. Then I started getting notifications every minute still with no baby in the crib. Then I would get multiple notifications randomly. Finally they stopped coming altogether. Monitor is alright. I haven't really had much to compare it to.In the phone app I used to be able to turn the music on and off and now it won't work at all unless I do it from the monitor.I haven't contacted Motorola yet, but hopefully they can do something about this <U+0001F611>"
"2097","2","This prob should have been less stars for me.... But with some changes i think it could be great.... First issue out of the box, micro USB for the charging. I plugged in the baby monitor and it died, yes the micro USB was that loose.  Then i tried connecting it to my wifi for remote viewing ( the whole reason i bought the expensive version) and it failed.  So i tried about 10 more times with it failing every time. Finally i gave up and ordered an IP camera.... Sad because i wanted the monitor portion of the setup and liked the temp function."
"2098","1","I wanted to love this monitor. We have a normal monitor by Motorola but I wanted 1 with remote access and a handheld. I had high hopes for this but it fell very short. It doesn't work well as a remote monitor nor using the actual handheld. The sound cuts out continually and the only way to get it working again is to unplug the camera and plug it back in. This only fixes it for about 15 minutes. I will be returning this product and sticking with my current model."
"2099","2","After researching every monitor on the market with a dedicated screen this was the best option out there. It was chosen because of the overall poor market choices not because the product is great. We bought one in late 2015, had Motorola replace the monitor once due to issues. The second monitor failed but was out of the year warranty so forced to buy new again. That was a choice due to having three cameras already.The monitor itself is pretty reliable for viewing, noise, tempature and the mobile app is a nice perk too.It<U+2019>s the the best option of the poor choices out there. There might be better options but they are all phone app only monitors which make it challenging to use."
"2100","2","Purchased the camera and monitor in 3015 and needed an additional camera. Overall I am not impressed with this product. The monitor is constantly losing signal with one of the cameras for no reason. It typically happens in the middle of the night which is beyond annoying. The monitor video has a tendency to freeze. Contacted the customer service and after multiple emails back and forth they asked me for the proof of purchase. I had assumed I would receive a replacement. I never heard back from them.The good aspects battery isn<U+2019>t too bad and good distance signal. Hence the reason for 2 stars. I<U+2019>m not sure I<U+2019>d recommend this purchase though for these qualities."
"2101","2","I purchased 2 of these.  The first one was defective.  On the monitor, to pan you would have to hold down the button and it would be delayed.  When I inquired about the product, I was informed that you should be able to just push the button and the camera should move.  The night vision was ok, not really clear if you were to zoom in.  The wifi works sometimes but isn't accurate.  At home I was watching my baby on my phone and it looked ok, didn't have the thinking button so I didn't think anything until I heard the child screaming.  I looked at the monitor and still didn't have anything but the baby still in the same position however when I went in the house he was indeed up.  The second unit that I received which was the replacement still has problems.  In order to pan on the monitor you can sometimes tap the button but for the most part you will have to hold down the arrow buttons.  The delay isn't as bad as the first one however the night vision on this one is horrible.  Everything is a blue hint and it blurry.  Then the wifi on this one doesn't even connect to our phones.  Pointless because you pay for a WIFI camera.  I will be returning this one too and getting a different brand.  You would think that because it is Motorola it would be better?"
"2102","3","Been using it for 8 months, and If I could go back, I<U+2019>d probably get a different monitor. This one has been good, but the main thing we like about it, I think, is a function that comes with most monitors these days. And the rest we either haven<U+2019>t used or find fault with.It<U+2019>s nice to be able to pan around and zoom in on different areas of the crib. And with nothing to compare to, it also has a pretty good picture and night vision.Another reason we chose this monitor was for the option to use it with our iPhones via the app. In our experience, the  attempt to go back and forth between the app and handheld parent device caused a lot of freezing and glitches, so now we use the parent device exclusively. I know we could have saved a lot of money downgrading to lots of other options that didn<U+2019>t have this feature. So that has been a waste.Then there are some minor complaints that I wish were different on the parent device. Volume control should be easily and quickly accessed in my opinion, perhaps a dial on the side that can be silenced immediately rather than the two step process it is here, push the menu screen, scroll to volume, then arrow down volume clicks. Seems trivial, but when baby wakes up screaming, it<U+2019>s nice to turn it down quickly before it rouses everyone up.  Also the addition of a clock on the device would be really helpful. I care far less about the temp of the nursery than I would for the time at all hours if the night, trying to weigh how long before I get up to get baby.The monitor also likes to mysteriously shut down and restart in the middle of the night a few times a week. No idea why. But when it does, it makes a terrible noise on the parent end that wakes us both."
"2103","1","Hate, hate, HATE this monitor!  Honestly little research was done before purchasing the Motorola Digital Video Baby Monitor because we have use Motorola products and always had a great experience.  Our previous video monitor used with our first child was wonderful; simply, six years later it was outdated.We bought and set the monitor up just before our baby arrived; it seemed to work well for the first month.  The picture quality was nice, the sound was good and we enjoyed the many features it had to offer. Out of nowhere the monitor began acting up.  Random times during the day and night the monitor will start sounding the alarm the camera has been turned off (trust me this sound will get you out of bed really quick in the middle of the night...).  Often times the monitor will say it is out of range even when it is in our room which is across the hall from the baby's room.  The most annoying part of the monitor is in order to charge it the charger only charges when in a specific position, its very sensitive.  The connection between the monitor and the charger is and has always been loose since time of purchase.  The monitor, when fully charged, only holds an hour or two tops before going dead.  This is also while keeping the video set to off and only the volume on.  For this reason it would have been better to purchase a cheap $20 monitor with sound only.I regret buying the Motorola Digital Video Baby Monitor.  It is one of the more pricey monitors on the market, one would think the product would be without flaws.  As a consumer my expectations of the monitor system have not been met.  I would not recommend this product."
"2104","1","Garbage. 100% garbage. I've gone through 2 of these in the last 1.5 years. The power port on the first one was loose causing intermittent power. The same thing with the second one with the added ""benefit"" of intermittent, random inoperability. The remote camera controls are horrible. It shows great signal, but yet I need to hold a directional button toove the camera for at least 3 seconds before it responds; tapping it once doesn't cut it. The battery is also trash. It shows full and sometimes doesn't last 30 minutes after a 2-4 charge. Wonder if I can still replace/return it?"
"2105","2","Why, WHY can't you turn off the beeping on this monitor!? It somehow goes in and out of range, despite the fact that it isn't moving. And when it does so, it beeps like an alarm clock! Even if it's on mute! I do not understand this feature!It works fine otherwise. I like the panning of the camera and the picture seems fine. I would NEVER buy again for the beeping reasons alone.FYI...I am writing this at 3:47 am after being woken up a couple of hours ago by the monitor beeping and can't fall back to sleep!"
"2106","2","I've been using this monitor for a year now.  Like other reviewers I can confirm this camera is not HD (which is not a huge issue for me but is false advertising by Motorola). The camera will go offline randomly approximately once a week and need to be power cycled.  The buttons on the monitor screen are poorly designed and organized.  It can be a huge nightmare to pair the camera and monitor if it ever requires that.  I've had to do it a few times and it takes many attempts repearting the same steps over and over until they magically work.  The sound has permanently gone out from our monitor, a friend of ours who has the same unit has had the same exact issue.  Setting the time on the monitor does no good as it resets it on its own every night.  Worst of all it is very expensive.The only reason I give it two stars is because you can simultaneously watch your child on the monitor and on your smart phone which is very handy.  I think I'm being very generous here.If I would have known a year ago what I know now I would have never bought this monitor.  Motorola should be ashamed for putting out such a subpar product and asking top dollar for it."
"2107","1","We really wanted to like this baby monitor.  It had all of the features I was looking for.  However, it became apparent very fast that the micro USB charger was the weak point of the design.  Within less than 2 months the charging cable began falling out of the Parent unit.  If it didn't fall out completely, it would not charge unless the plug was angled just right.  It's a shame that most of the new monitors have all adopted the micro USB charging.  I have now purchased an older model from Motorola that does not have micro USB charging.  I would strongly advise staying away from any design with a Micro USB charger.  The monitor would die in the middle of the night (even when plugged in) and start beeping because of the low battery warning.  If you don't hear the warning, the monitor dies completely and you realize it in the morning when you wake up.  Terribly frustrating experience with this monitor."
"2108","1","ive spent a year with this thing. Im finally throwing it away. In the trash. I wont give it to anyone, or re sell it because it's that terrible. Here is a small list of issues:1. capacative buttons work 30% of the time without me smashing my finger on them over and over2. audio cuts out constantly3. it turned itself all the way down one night while we were sleeping4. turned itself off one night while we were sleeping5. the feed cuts out constantly6. the power source is loose on the back so we have to rig it to not fall out of the camera7. it claims to be HD... this thing is early 90's security cam quality at best8. the color shifts constantly. One day the whole screen is purply, the next its yellow9. it will randomly make a hissing noise for about 5 seconds at any given time10. the music function doesnt work at allThis just scratches the surface. The only reason i kept it is because it worked great for about 3 months before it went nuts on us. Buying a new monitor today. It wont be this one. It wont be by motorola. And it will be WONDERFUL.DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA. EVER."
"2109","2","We seemed to have had issues with this system from the start. We've had it for about 3 months and are now looking for a new one. I really don't know if we went a while day without some minor glitch. The monitor does have some good features but the overall performance takes away from those positive features. Here are the major issues we've had:-Night vision is poor unless camera is about 2 feet from desired viewing area which isn't very helpful.-Viewing monitor has very short battery life.-Cords lose connection easily. One camera and the viewing monitor cords were slightly bent and were temperamental. Camera cord was often disturbed in some way resulting in the camera not working at all. Viewing monitor often wasn't charging even if it looked plugged in.-Lost connection a lot for no reason. Worked fine one minute then randomly the alarm would go off indicating a lost connection then would randomly fix itself. It's really annoying to be awakened several times a night for no real reason. Also the sound would randomly stop and we had to turn the camera off then back on. Not a big deal until you have to sneak into your sleeping child's room in the middle of the night to do this and it wakes them up!-Touch screen on viewing monitor was not great. We often had to push buttons many times before the until would respond.Giving 2 stars because the camera quality is very good during the day and we liked how the cameras can be turned using the viewing monitor."
"2110","1","The first one of these I bought worked flawlessly for 6 months until the parent unit fell off the night stand and the screen stopped working. I figured it should have been more durable than that but gave Motorola the benefit of the doubt and bought another one. On the second set I purchased one of the directional buttons on the parent unit didn't work, the camera would not pan in certain directions and the camera would frequently lose mobile connectivity. So because my wife really liked the the first set we ordered when it was working I returned the second set and ordered a third one. When this set arrived it was immediately apparent that it had been used (seemingly significantly) and returned. The packaging was not sealed and was torn, the original stickers had been sloppily been put back on the monitor and the parent unit was scratched and scuffed as if it had seen a good deal of use. This wouldn't have been a bid deal if the set had actually worked. The picture on the parent unit was grainy and unclear compared to the previous units we received, the picture jumped frequently and I tried unsuccessfully for a couple hours to get the camera to connect to the Hubble app with no luck. It's as if someone returned this set because it didn't work and Amazon just repackaged it and sent it on to the next customer hoping they would accept a partially functional monitor or just be too lazy to return it."
"2111","1","Sounded too good to be true.  The camera pairing was painful because the cameras are not wireless.  Once paired the process of loading the Hubble software made me hate this thing even more.  After days of uninstalling and reinstalling the app I finally Googled for help.  This mess only allows one remote device per camera.  So now I can see with one camera and my brother can see with the other but neither allows us to see both.  This was undocumented and would have been a deal breaker had I known it.Also, the app keeps dumping me with error messages which requires me to restart and key all sign on info rather than caching it.  The app is a huge disappointment.  I will be rating that next.  It is buggy, clumsy and should have failing integration and/or QA."
"2112","2","I<U+2019>m giving this camera 2 stars instead of only 1, because as long as it<U+2019>s working, I<U+2019>m satisfied with the sound and camera quality.Dislike:The pan and tilt is useless. If it decides to work at all, the delay is immense and frustrating.The wi-fi feature is useless. I should have gotten a less expensive version without wi-fi. I<U+2019>ve grown tired of repeatedly having to re-pair the camera to the network between uses, so I don<U+2019>t use it at all anymore.While using the camera, the video feed will randomly stop, and the monitor beeps annoying loud because there is no more video connection. I then have to shut off and restart the monitor multiple times for it to finally re-Connect to the camera. The camera is plugged in all the time, and the monitor has plenty of battery when this happens, so power can<U+2019>t be the issue. Furthermore, the monitor is sitting at the same spot untouched, so moving too far away from camera is not the problem either."
"2113","1","I would not recommend this camera.  If we  could have returned the camera we would have but we bought it on sale on prime day in July our child was not born until November  so by the time we realized the issues it was too late.  When the camera is working as it should it's great  but we have had several different issues.With our first monitor if the picture was not displayed,  like when it's in the battery saving mode, the sound would not work. The issue with our second monitor was that the connectivity stopped working so at 3am it started beeping waking us up and would not work leaving us without a monitor.  Motorola told us it was due to a firmware update. We are now waiting for a third unit to arrive.  Great customer service however  I have had to call back after they said they would replace it because they forgot to ship it both times."
"2114","3","NOT impressed. There are not many wifi monitors so we did go with the Motorola due to the brand reputation. We kept reading mixed reviews on all of the wifi monitors so it was just the one we picked. The video cameras need re-set regularly as they will stop reporting sound. The quality of the material isn't lacking. After 1yr the charging cord couldnt be inserted due to the port becoming super lose, and when it was plugged in, it had to be tilted just so in order to charge. The antennae became loose, and the kickstand came completely off. We did just get our second monitor to replace the 1st, but only bc we already had 2 cameras that are not compatible with other monitors. The picture is nice... the screen is big. Installation is easy."
"2115","1","HA HA HA LAUGHABLE PRODUCT!!!  HORRIBLE PICTURE QUALITY ON the viewer and on remote.  NOT 720p!  I REPEAT NOT EVEN CLOSE to 720p! My 3 year old summer infant has an insanely better picture and faster response time when set side by side.  TERRIBLE TERRIBLE buttons and general interface!  HORRIBLE interface.  Not quick or easy to navigate AT ALL.  ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE TERRIBLE DESIGN!!!  DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT BUY!  YOU THERE ARE MUCH MUCH BETTER OPTIONS OUT THERE!  However, this is one of only 3 that I can find that has a viewer and can be viewed remotely.  I'm returning this product because it is WAY WAY Behind the times for a little over 300 doll hairs.  It was clearly designed with ZERO thought into functionality and very little emphasis placed on performance quality."
"2116","1","Concept is awesome but practically, it totally fails to deliver. We're on our third Motorola monitor and this one was the worst and most expensive. We used it with the parent base and the latter beeps LOUDLY whenever it loses connection with the camera - which happens somewhat frequently. The camera also beeps sometimes, which is rather annoying if the baby is sleeping. The image is much fuzzier than the other monitor we had. Also, when the camera is on, there's a flashing little light which only draw attention from my little  toddler (changes from blue to red). My husband said the app was terrible, so I didn't even bother to download it. Returning it and going back to the old school non-wireless Motorola. Bummed."
"2117","2","This is my second set of this baby monitor. The first one I will say worked well past age 2 and I think it failed because my son pulled the parent unit down from on the dresser and it took a good hit on the hardwood floors. I was expecting our daughter and needed another camera anyway so I ordered the same thing to still be able to use the camera from my son<U+2019>s room and just add-on to what we had. This one however, is a complete bust. My daughter is only 6 months old and the parent unit is acting up. No video streaming and sound only comes from my daughters room, not my son<U+2019>s. It makes noise when he makes noise, but not even enough to call crackle or enough to wake us up. No matter how loud he<U+2019>s screaming. Nothing wrong with the cameras in either room as we can stream both from the app on our phones. But that<U+2019>s not all that reliable for all night as the stream sometimes cuts out and doesn<U+2019>t restart. I contacted Motorola customer service via email and it took about 45 days to get a response, and they offered to replace my parent unit. Great! But not for only $20 less than what I could but a whole new set for! Thanks, but no. $50, even $75 for just a replacement parent unit absolutely. But not $150!!"
"2118","1","This is the worst monitor!  Right from the start the charging mechanism wasn<U+2019>t working properly.  Trying to contact Motorola is actually a joke there is no direct phone number you have to fill out a form online.  Once you fill out the form they give you a reference number then you can call them up and put the reference number in and finally talk to somebody. I filled  it out three times before they actually got back to me. The first time I spoke to the guy and I explained to him it was the monitor connector for the charger not working but instead he sent me a replacement battery.  I then had to go through the whole process again of filling the form out online and talk to somebody.  Did I mention that the reference number expires after four days so you have to do it all over again!  Finally they sent me a new monitor !  Now I<U+2019>m on mono number two and guess what three months later the same thing happened. I<U+2019>m so over it that I don<U+2019>t even feel like going to the process I rather buy an out a new onePreviously had a summer infant monitor but  I wanted a wireless monitor for my second child I previously had a summer infant monitor which I had slight trouble with the battery not holding a charge everytime. I had to contact them there was a phone number you can get in touch with them right away and they replaced the battery no problem."
"2119","1","I spent a lot of time looking into different monitors, to make sure i got one with the features i was looking for. While i was happy with this purchase initially, it is not even 6 months old and it needs to be replaced. The cameras are fine, but the monitor has all kinds of problems. The cord has a major weight on it, which pulls on it enough that the connection fails. I<U+2019>ve had to rig the cord up all kinds of ways to keep it from shutting off. I eventually had to buy a new cord to replace the original. The battery power is super low, and the alert when it<U+2019>s about to die is enough to wake the baby on it<U+2019>s own! The monitor has a pretty clear picture, but it goes in and out of color for no reason when it shouldn<U+2019>t (ex - full daylight). The sound was fine in the beginning, with the exception of a pretty significant delay and echo. (I was aware that others had mentioned the echo prior to my purchasing it, but it is more significant than i had expected). However, now it is super difficult to hear anything in the room monitored. Nothing on the camera end (microphone, cord, placement of the device) has changed, but the monitor itself is crap."
"2120","2","Less than a week after receiving this monitor we had to call and have a new one sent to us because it wouldn't connect to the receiver. Then, our new one has had a myriad of problems. We have had it for one year, but about 2 months in the night vision stopped working. We can barely see our kid in her bed at night and if the nightlight isn't on we can't see anything. Then, the clock stopped working. We continued to use it because we just decided it wasn't worth the hassle of trying to get ANOTHER new one but it basically became a sound monitor bc at night we could see hardly anything at best. Then, about a week ago it just completely stopped charging. We bought this thinking we could add cameras to it as our family grew but it has been nothing but problems."
"2121","2","7 months after purchase and this thing is busted! Not only does the connector port in the monitor no longer work, but we have to reset each camera about once/week. It's great that it comes with an app for additional viewing, but if the wifi gets reset you're out of luck trying to view your child.I went to a retail store to replace the monitor screen - since we bought two cameras - to find out that Motorola brand monitors are not compatible with each other, so we have to buy an entirely new system.Do not waste your money on this!!!"
"2122","1","Not impressed.  I have had several of the Motorola monitors over the years.  This one was by far the worst one yet! I had it 3 days and returned it.  The camera kept losing connection to the parent unit and each night I had to re-pair the units.  The parent unit would turn off our of no where. The lights on the front would not spike if sound was heard.  The two-way communication didn't work half the time.  The app to use with the camera didn't function great either.  For the cost I am extremely disappointed.  This camera was a huge letdown.  Motorola's products are certainly not living up to the standards you would expect from such a high priced product."
"2123","4","This video monitor works well.  It has great functions like music playing and a speaker to talk to the kids.  The bonus is that it's Wi-Fi so my husband can participate in bed time when he's out of town.  We've had some problems lately with there being a poor connection on my cell phone and constant searching for signal.  I'm hoping that a software update will help that because before this week - it's been great.  The nigh vision is actually pretty good with decent detail.  I mean - it's not military grade - but do you need that to sky on your baby?"
"2124","1","Really horrible experience. Since day one this camera has been loosing the signal, and it is at very close distance from the monitor. This causes that every night the camera start making noises indicating the signal has been lost. So now we have been sleeping bad not because of my baby, but because of the camera.We used to have the old version of this camera at the same distance (camera to monitor), and we never had this problem. The worst of all, it the camera advertise that one of its great features is <U+201C>the reach of distance from the camera to the monitor<U+201D>.Do not buy it if you want to sleep decently."
"2125","1","UPDATE: Its been 4 months now and monitor. O longer charges.  For the price, i would expect this product to have lasted longer than 4 months.Picture isnt very clear and delayed.  I wish i had gotten the Samsung 3037. Was cheaper, i had previously and it worked great until my son broke the antenna.  Lesson learned that price doesnt determine quality.  I received this as a baby shower gift and by the time I got to use it and relaozed it wasnt of good quality,, it was too late to return!"
"2126","2","I was excited when I ordered this monitor because of it's many features and great screen, but in reality, this monitor has been a total headache. The first parent unit I had would intermittently lose the sound without warning (extremely dangerous when I am relying on this monitor to hear my infant in the night, and the volume goes out without warning - while I'm asleep.) While the unit was still under warranty, I reached out to Motorola about the issue. They sent me a replacement parent unit. After two months, the new parent unit began having the exact same issue. The only way I could get the sound to work again was to unplug and re-plug in the camera (not convenient, and again, not safe when the sound goes out when you're asleep and relying on the monitor to hear if your infant is crying in their own bedroom.) I don't trust this product to help me monitor my baby, and am not even bothering to reach out to Motorola again since their replacement unit was also faulty. Don't waste your money on this product!"
"2127","4","Having a baby web camera is a must for every parent since it allows you to keep an eye on your child when he/she takes a nap or sleeps at night as you do something else without having to enter in your child's room every five minutes to check.Pros: Easy to install, night vision, very powerful mic that allows you to hear EVERY single sound and room temperature indicatorCons: you have to pay to record,sometimes it is unstable and night vision stops working if you watch the video in two devices at the same time.I recommend this product. Since my wife and I started to use it with my little girl combined with a Snuza Hero we can relax more often. (Sorry for my english, it is not my mother tongue)."
"2128","1","I have gone through 4 of these monitors now. I am finally returning the last one and getting a completely different brand. The first one worked fine, but then had a white line running through the parent unit. The second one wouldn<U+2019>t detect motion out of the blue one day. The third one had poor camera quality and now this last one has stopped with the motion detection AND keeps saying <U+201C>disconnected<U+201D> on the parent unit randomly. Also, the mobile app is TERRIBLE. Whatever you do, do not update to the most recent one. It takes forever to load and crashes constantly. I wanted this camera to work so badly, but it just doesn<U+2019>t."
"2129","1","I wanted to like this product because I loved the idea of checking in on our baby while at work or running errands through the app, and also loved that it promised HD picture quality. IMonitor display is awful, says HD but the picture quality, especially in night vision is terrible. Monitor turns on and off even with high speed and working internet leaving me worried throughout the night that I may not hear my crying baby. Customer service is terrible. Responded after my initial issue, then after I provided further info of which they asked in order to get replaced went radio silent. If they were able to replace the damaged monitor, I may would be able to compare to see if a properly functioning monitor works as promised, however since they refuse to respond, guess we'll never know. I do not recommend this product."
"2130","2","The power plug on the parent unit isn't durable, and starting a few months ago won't charge unless the plug is at just the right angle. Then, a faint breeze will cancel it all. I've gotten good at looping and propping it to get a charge, but unreliable without constant monitoring. I should be looking at the display for baby activity, not for unit charging success. Average usage plugged in next to the couch appears too much. Also, just today the audio quit. Thankfully we bought the camera that connects to the app, but that digital connection won't replace the need for a physical monitor."
"2131","1","After reading a few reviews I'm realizing that the similar issue is happening to mine. The monitor stop charging so I switch the cable for the camera and the monitor hoping it would help. It did for a while but now the cable for the camera is acting up and basically disconnect. I have to find the proper position every night and sometime it just disconnect in the middle of the night making my monitor beep. I'm researching now where to purchase an extra cable. But it looks like it might not fix the problem after reading divers review. The app also stop working and it's asking me to pay after an upgrade they did. I didn't keep the paper with the info so I basically cannot use it. It's ridiculous.I'm very disappointed. This is the kind a stress that new parents don't need in their life. I thought investing a little money into it would avoid me the additional stress. I would not recommend this product.<U+00A0>"
"2132","3","This product is nice when it works. I've had issues where the sound doesn't work and sometimes the screen doesn't show the room, it just shows the Motorola logo. I have to double check that the sound is working every night to make sure I can hear my newborn crying."
"2133","1","Purchased this product as a lightning deal and maybe I was a little too excited about the great price because I ignored all the negative reviews. So many of them were related to WI-FI range and ease of connection that I dismissed them as people with poor service/knowledge. The bottom line is that while the handheld monitor is nice as well as the temperature monitoring function, it all doesn't matter when the picture quality is this terrible. Day or night, this device can't even compare to cheaper market rivals. In addition, while you can pan left/right or up/down with the camera, the scope of vision at a time is very narrow and only allows you to see a small portion of the room at once."
"2134","2","Not a fan. Wish I had gone with a different monitor. The monitor screen tends to have random glitches throughout the night. The battery life is really short. First it would hold charge for about 3 hours, then went to just a little over an hour...pretty annoying. The app that can be watched away from home is what sold me mostly and now I wish I had gone with just a basic monitor with excellent reviews. Also, the unit itself is too heavy to use one of those mounts that hang from the wall. I attempted and the camera itself fell twice. Hope this helps someone."
"2135","2","Really disappointed!! I first bought the 36S and it's surprisingly working well for now, I bought it like a month ago. So I went with my instincts and bought this camera thinking it will be even better. Well, that was not the case, it was horrible. The lag,video, compared to other camera is really long. The voice sensitivity is extremely poor as well. Moving to app, it's not that bad but it feels like you are using a 1999 camera. It takes a long time to tilt the camera from the sec you click on the button in the app and when the camera responds and starts to move is horrible. I returned this camera and kept my other one and I might buy another separate wireless camera(Nest, Arlo, Logi) to check on my baby from work. The one on the right hand side is the HD and other one is the 36s (Non HD)."
"2136","1","I bought this monitor so that I could both have a wireless video monitor that didn't rely on WiFi, AND so that I could remotely view using my phone.The remote viewing with the phone is actually pretty great - Motorola just rolled out an update to the app that's used, Hubble, and it's pretty terriffic. You can see video or hear audio of the thing that occurred, and you get notifications on your phone when your baby stirs.  The only downside might be that the camera pan/tilt controls are a bit laggy, but they still work.However, the SERIOUS problem with this device is the parent unit, or the wireless video monitor.  EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. you turn the screen on, it fails to pair with the camera.  The only way to resolve this, in my experience of nearly a month of frustration, is to turn off the camera, turn off the screen, then turn on the camera, and turn on the screen.  BUT this only works about 1 out of 50 times, so you are spending  up to 15 minutes each night trying to get the screen to work. In the meantime, the screen is making a ever so helpful *beeep* noise, to let you know it's not paired.  NO KIDDING - that's why there's no video on the screen?  The Motorola website and manual provide no useful workaround for this FATAL flaw in the BASIC functionality of their product.My evaluation: SAVE YOUR MONEY. Buy the version that doesn't have a screen. The camera itself works just fine.  But the screen implementation is a WASTE.OF.TIME.AND.MONEY."
"2137","2","I've have 2 cameras and 1 parent monitor. I have a few issues. #1- I have to reconnect the cameras fairly often  (7 times in 9 months) for no particular reason.  #2- The signal is pretty bad! Its loses its signal often (for some reason mostly at night). Recently it has started beeping and it hasn't even lost the signal! Its just fine. It just wants me to touch it! #3- The picture quality in night mode is not great. #4-It cannot display the correct time no matter how many times I change it. These cameras are pretty good when they work, but unfortunately I have not had great luck. I expected more from a company as reputable as Motorola."
"2138","2","It's motorola so it has a big brand name and is a quality product? nope. The hand held died already. I bought this on 8/18/17, it is now 10/24/17. Handheld is totally dead already!!! Yes, you can use your phone to view baby, however, there is a pretty solid delay most of the time on the feed and the image quality fluctuates constantly. ALSO, you can not use the app on your phone to view baby at the same time as someone using the handheld (which I will hopefully get a replacement soon). So you can't check on baby from work without interrupting the signal for the handheld monitor. Just some food for thought.... Also, the camera has an annoying red/blue alternating blinking light in the room when you're trying to connect to it. That's not going to get baby's attention at all...."
"2139","5","Works great, both via monitor and iphone. signal strength is good unless you have concrete and metal walls. in that case it is a little weak in the monitor but the phone can be used in that case.  I read reviews about people having trouble with monitor. Image quality is not that great but it works good, especially at night with the night vision, there is no light to disturb the baby. I also read that the internet option did not work for some people overseas. It works great, there was no issue with installation. also I liked that the camera will not connect to a password free internet source (for protection)."
"2140","3","ok but not greatperfect product if i would not have had those 2 issues:-build quality/reinforcement around the usb connector, little one puled on the cable and connector got ruined on 2 units, that usb connector is not suitable for this product, as a magnetic connector, or something more resilient-i have 3 cameras and almost always one camera is down it disconnects and red led blinks, and i have to manually unplug/plug the power."
"2141","2","Why would there ever be a loud warning beep on the camera (not the monitor, the camera) meant for a sleeping baby? Seriously, I would like to know... Who would think, ""oh, that's a good idea, you know, if the internet connection goes down, we should wake up the baby and tell them - HEY, YOUR PARENTS LOST INTERNET CONNECTION FOR 10 SECONDS!!!! WAKE UUUUUPPPPPP!!!""Sweet.Otherwise, yeah, it works as advertised, but until this problem is fixed, it is the opposite of what you want."
"2142","1","Do NOT buy this product. At first, it was the camera that wouldn't charge. Ok, no big deal - just leave it plugged in. Then the monitor started shutting off periodically in the middle of the night without warning. I would wake up in the morning not knowing how long it had been off...but I was dealing with it. Now, the cord won't connect to the monitor and it just shorted out completely. I can't believe they put out such a terrible product that I'm depending on to help keep my child safe.I read reviews about trying to call the company to get a replacement....sounds like that will be a lost cause.Don't waste your money!!"
"2143","1","One of the cameras completely stop working after 2 months of use. The volume on the monitor would only work occasionally. The monitor would initially hold a 5 hour charge, after using it only 2 month the monitor only held a 2 hour charge at the longest. The camera would often not detect the monitor causing annoying beeps even though it was only 4 ft from the camera. And worst of all the monitor and camera would beep randomly in the middle of the night waking us up, for new parents this is not good. Do not buy this monitor, its terrible."
"2144","5","Read all the reviews, and compared all the cameras. I consider myself VERY tech savvy but did want a camera that was easy to operate for non-tech folks. Camera is very easy to setup - up and running in minutes using provided instructions. Wanted a camera that pans/tilts, zooms, temperature, phone app, remote/web viewing. Video recording and 2 way voice communication was on my wish list, but not deal makers. Built-in lullabies are 'electronic' versions of common songs, and sound ok.At first was very upset with the purchase. Previous negative reviews held true. Then after approx 1 week. the following happend:1) Firmware on camera was auto-updated (camera automatically talked to Motorola server for update, was unaware this was going to happen until it did)2) iPhone app was updatedsince then, almost everything works great.Here are the problems/issues at present:1) IMHO, the camera is choppy on public wifi. Works great over cellular. Works perfect on local/home wifi. There is a delay on the video, and in my experience is it <5 sec and usually 1-2 sec on local wifi, and only a tad longer over cellular.2) Remote viewing outside of wifi uses Motorola server as a middle-man. Occasionally server is not accessible, and will give outage for 10-30 minutes. No prior notification is provided via email, website, or other method that this is going to occur.3) Phone app shows an option to buy Motorola's cloud recording service. This is ever-present. Also frequently receive emails to buy/try cloud service.4) 2 way intercom is horrible - as works on an intercom / walkie-talkie method of communication (unlike cell phones). Would not use this as a selling point, but it is present if needed/desired.Overall still happy with purchase and will probably buy another if needed."
"2145","1","Why wont it connect to the internet just 2months after my purchase, practically cant use it anymore. Frustrated to say the least.This is a year after the purchase and i camd back to uldate my dislime for this camera. Yeah, couldnt use it all year. Still does not work at all. Such a waste of money. Such a waste."
"2146","5","Very clear picture, day or night. Shows temperature, easy to rotate where you want the camera pointed by using the monitor/app. Picture quality in app is excellent. Nice to use when you have to go out of monitor range (like the shared laundry room at my apartment complex) or want to check in remotely."
"2147","2","Great for the first few months and then the charger stopped working--connection to the monitor is loose and will not charge unless you sit and hold it in place.  A real shame since we rely on this during naps and at night.  Poorly made and now have to buy a new one.  Should have listened to other customer reviews!!!"
"2148","1","I usually don<U+2019>t write reviews but I had to with this purchase - a few months after using this camera I started having issues with the connection of the camera to the monitor constantly. It kept cutting out and I kept having to mess with the connection constantly. It would wake us up in the middle of the night with the obnoxious beeping it makes when there is a bad connection. The WiFi was also a constant issue and hardly worked with my cell phone. The connector broke off today. DO NOT BUY."
"2149","1","My monitor has been slowly falling apart. It is only 3 months old. Each day something new breaks. DO NOT BUY THIS MONITOR! Here are two photos of the screen. It turns crazy colors all the time and sometimes the split screen looks like this... Useless! My most recent frustration is the terrible static noise it makes all night long. <U+0001F620> As of I wasn't getting little enough sleep as it is."
"2150","2","Great features and quality but the camera and parent unit keep losing signal and beeping. I had my previous Motorola model for almost 3 yrs with no issues but am now moving to a different brand with two failed tries on this brand."
"2151","1","One of the few baby monitors that does it all(or supposed to at least) I read all the bad reviews and thought I would risk it because it does have a small handful of decent reviews. Well I lost the bet because this product is very expensive junk. We never know from night to night if it will work. We have awoken from the screams of our baby through the walls and look at the monitor only to discover that it decided not to work at some point in the night. And when it does work, the speaker on the parent unit is so inadequate that you can only hear the loud cries. Forget about trying to hear your baby grunt and start to stir prior to the cry or much less hear your baby breathe. TRUST ME! Don't buy"
"2152","1","This baby monitor is awful! This is the 3rd video monitor our family has gone through over the years (the other 2, VTech and Levana, were broken purely on accident by our family!) This is by far the worst one. Brand new out of the package, 2 of the buttons wouldn<U+2019>t work and I couldn<U+2019>t move the camera from the monitor. The buttons on the monitor that do work are very delayed from when you push them. Now on day 2, the Charger isn<U+2019>t charging properly. For how much this monitor cost, you would think it would work properly right out of the packages! Sending it back and buying another V tech!"
"2153","1","This thing is junk. After a couple months I could no longer view the camera remotely on my phone. Now the sound has stopped working. We've only been using this thing for 4 months. Buy a different monitor."
"2154","5","Easy to use and figure out. The battery is long lasting, the coverage is excellent. The picture is very good. This monitor far exceeds one we had previously that we bought with our first child two years ago. I would highly recommend this monitor."
"2155","3","Extremely expensive considering competitors prices. Images are the lowest possible definition specially over the phone app. Camera tilting and panning are very slow.Sound comes out fine, you can control music in the camera and speak back to the camera. Wi-fi connectivity is very easy including with the phone app, took me less than 5 minutes to set it up. All in all it would be a 5 stars if costed around $100-120 for the price it is a 3 stars at best."
"2156","3","I purchased this but returned it.  mine was defective I think.  it flickers a lot and the night vision didn't work.  it states or was on but I couldn't see my daughter.  it also picked up on all white noise and other little sounds so it was hard to tell if my daughter was up or not."
"2157","2","i bought this August 2016 and my baby was born 3 months ago so i hadn't reviewed until i got to fully experience the product. After about a month and a half the battery started acting up. now it month 3 of using it and it only keeps charge for about 15 min. very disappointed."
"2158","5","Love this camera! This is our second one (Irish twins) and we couldn<U+2019>t imagine using anything else. Super easy to set up, app works great and we really enjoy the temp feature to keep baby<U+2019>s room perfect during summer and winter. Would highly recommend to anyone!!!!"
"2159","1","Buying a baby-monitor was a pretty big decision and after lots and lots of research, I finally settled on this one and I have to say, I've been very disappointed with it overall.  My needs when I bought a monitor were a little more than standard because my wife and I disagreed on what we both wanted.  She wanted a traditional baby-monitor that she could set up in another room of the house and see out little guy.  I wanted one that we could view online since I travel a lot and wanted to be able to look in on him.  This was our compromise and although it was definitely pricey, we thought it would be exactly what we both wanted.Pros: There are several good things about this.  The camera is fairly sharp (although not HD quality) and works well in both high and low light situations.  We might not be able to make out the little marks on his skin but we can clearly see what he is up to, whether he's crying, thrashing around, taking off his socks, taking off his mittens...etc.  From that's aspect its certainly good enough.  The cameras controls were pretty good as well, we could easily manipulate it to get a good view of the crib or pan around the room and the zoom feature worked well.  Additionally, you can turn the volume off and it has a noise meter on the top that shows from green to yellow to red when he cries so we can see if he's a little upset or screaming like crazy.  That's really handy when one of us is sleeping so we want the volume off but we still want good SA on whats going on.Cons: Really, there's two that I can't stand about this product and cause me to give it only 1 star.  The first is that while you can play lullaby music, it comes through the monitor so loud that you almost can't keep it on when you are monitoring the baby.  Its a bit of a quibble but even at min volume, its loud as crap so I have to mute the monitor anytime I want to use the music feature.  You'd think that for this amount of coin, Motorola could do a selective mute but they don't and it makes that feature pretty worthless in my opinion.  The second flaw is much worse though.  The camera continually loses sync on the WiFi (thought the monitor does not from the exact same position).  There is nothing more frustrating than trying to put our baby down at 2am after a feeding and finding out the camera lost sync...again!  To make it worse, if the monitor can't find the camera, it makes an extremely loud beeping/fail tone that you cannot mute.  So I put the little guy down, and attempt to turn on the monitor and not only does it not work, but that stupid noise wakes my kid back up.  Its pretty much made this thing an un-usable product, definitely don't recommend as it causes crazy frustration at the worst possible time in the middle of the night, go by a product that works!"
"2160","1","I just ordered my 4th camera. Numbers 1-3 were all returned. I<U+2019>m really trying to make it work by adding a second camera to my mbp854 system but the constant loss of signal and sound is making that quite difficult. The camera beeps loudly waking my baby and the monitor sends off this ungodly alarm sound that wakes me in the most unpleasant way possible. It may be time to just spend another $300 on a different brand altogether."
"2161","1","the company is not very clear about the camera !!!! i have to plug the charge all the time !!! if i remove it then the camera is OFF IMMEDIATELY! why that ? im very sad about this stupid thing .... i think its just like the mbp855 ! but this is really bad from motorola <U+0001F593><U+0001F593><U+0001F593><U+0001F593><U+0001F593>"
"2162","1","We<U+2019>ve owned it less than a year and are currently waiting on our THIRD warranty replacement. The replacement process is slow and not at all customer friendly - and as we cannot hear our kids from their rooms without a monitor has left us having to change sleeping situations for weeks at a time ole we wait weeks for each replacement unit to arrive. Once this is out of warrranty we are done with Motorola."
"2163","4","This is a nice monitor, the nicest we could find in our research, just wish the range of control of movement was more sensitive. We move a smidge to the left on the control and the camera jumps so that the baby is most out of range on the viewing monitor."
"2164","1","Charger stopped working properly after a couple month. When it is plugged into the device it does not make a proper connection and won<U+2019>t charge or if I can get it in a certain spot it will charge for a little while and then stop which leads to a lovely loud beeping noice in the middle of the night. I have 3 cameras for the monitor to rotate through and it consistently will not pick up the signal on one of the cameras. I would suggest not going with Motorola for a baby monitor!"
"2165","2","It's really a shame because the features this camera offers make this an ideal choice for me and my family.  Unfortunately for us we have a very strange interference problem with newer cell phones.  As soon as anyone picks up their newer cell phone in my house and turns on their screen, the feed on the monitor cuts out.  Best I can tell from my research on the issue is ""Yes, this happens.  No, there isn't a fix.""  The picture does come back after a minute or so, but it's just a little too flaky for me to recommend."
"2166","5","Best buy ever!! My daughter has slept in her crip in her own room since she turned one month! Just need to look at monitor dark or light always able to see and hear ( my setting is just in one bar) her! I love the music setting , over great!!"
"2167","1","Awful.  The cord won't seat properly to charge the monitor without something propping it up at precisely a 14 degree angle, a folded towel under it, and a voodoo chanting spell.  The screen no has a permanently blue tint over the image, so our sweet baby boy looks more like a blurry smurf.  I've contacted customer support, and they said that due to the high volume of requests (no surprise there) that I would have to wait two days for a response.  That was 11 days ago.  I will be happy to post updates if there is any response."
"2168","1","Well I have had this for almost a year now. And it barely working. The screen lights up whenever it wants to the speaker on the monitor has stop working most of the time. And when it wants to work it blast the volume up so loud it's wakes  us up. Also some time the camera acts up and wakes up my son. We have never damaged any part of it so I don't know why it's acting this way.  I am very upset and I hope that who ever is looking into buying this one you should think twice. Well I guess I now have to go try and find another monitor for my son."
"2169","4","Bought this to monitor my elderly mother. Works well, even in low light. We don't use the microphone, as the TV is too loud in the room. Every once in awhile, we lose the signal from the camera, but a simple reboot fixes it."
"2170","2","Worked well for a while then the battery wouldn't work, they replaced it as it was under warranty. It has been beeping in the middle of the night multiple times due to ""going out range"" even though it has never moved, so annoying. Now the night vision is going out on it."
"2171","2","When it works it's fine, but the camera only last about 10-12 months before it stops working. We are on our third set and luckily they have all been under warranty (1 year) so we have been able to replace them without buying a new set. Pay attention to your warranty expiration date and if you think you are having ANY issues call customer service ASAP before your warranty is out. Motorola customer service has been helpful."
"2172","1","Terrible product. This worked for about a month and then started cutting in and out. We have gone back and forth with Motorola support for 2 months now with no success and the steps they provided to reset the monitor didn't even work.  Both the audio and video will cut out randomly and stop working for days at a time before coming back. I can't even trust this enough to leave our son along in his room for a nap much less overnight. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
"2173","1","If I could give this 0 stars, I would. Within two weeks of purchase, the plug for the charge on the monitor stopped staying in place, so the monitor died. I contacted support and they initially were responsive, but then stopped responding and I still haven<U+2019>t received a new monitor. Also, operating the camera from the monitor or the app is delayed and super annoying. In general, a cheap product that won<U+2019>t last and customer support that does nothing for you."
"2174","5","My husband and I wanted a camera that had a clear picture, a monitor, and connected to our phones. A few ladies pointed us to this monitor and I have to say it is PERFECT!"
"2175","2","The camera has a light. The light blinks on and off constantly. Why in the world would someone design something that<U+2019>s meant to go in a baby<U+2019>s room, where sleeping is supposed to occur, with a light that blinks?Also the handheld monitor beeps loudly when it loses connection to the camera. Since that has happened 5 times since I plugged it in 4 hours ago, guaranteed it will wake you up at night.The picture quality is good... Probably better to choose a different monitor."
"2176","1","Product will occasionally be on but lose the ability to transmit the audio. Static will come out but I will have to unplug and plug in the camera to reset it. The receiver will also occasionally just turn off while in use. I'd say about once a week the baby will be crying and we have no idea because one of the two issues has occurred."
"2177","4","Good camera. Dependable. Every now and again you will lose your WiFi connection but you know when you do because the background noise on your iphone stops. Really like the ability to dial in from anywhere to see the baby. You do have to pay for archived video, but they have different tiers and if you don't need to have archived video then it's completely free.  The Hubble app was a little difficult at first to get going, but it has worked great since working through the issue."
"2178","1","So disappointed in this purchase! <U+0001F614> If we can turn the thing on it has to be plugged in the entire time and in the middle of the night it just cuts off while even being plugged in! Battery life sucks bc if you unplug it it will die within a few hours. We used it when we put her to bed but have to use a backup non video one just in case but we know this one will not be working, seems like a lot of money to put into a product and doesn't even work most of the time. Very sad about it!!! <U+0001F630>"
"2179","1","I haven<U+2019>t been able to keep the camera connected to the app for longer than a day or so. The parent monitor is not registering sound or lights up like my son is screaming but he isn<U+2019>t. I feel like this was a huge waste of money especially when I can get something from the amazon collection that will connect to my other devices!"
"2180","3","Nice camera quality and the monitor is great. However, the WiFi strength is really low. It only connects in certain areas of the room and the app doesn<U+2019>t connect well at all. Takes quite a bit of time to load on our phones (we have great service and WiFi). Otherwise it is a nice product."
"2181","1","Worked great for 6 months, then just the other day parent screen stopped charging. I still can't get a charge from it, very frustrating. This is my 3rd try at a baby monitor, why is it so hard to find a good quality monitor. Very frustrating."
"2182","2","Disappointed and planning on returning. I have been using this monitor for the past 4 nights and have had an issue every night. I have a camera in my sons room and one in my daughters. In the middle of the night it will beep and say one of the cameras is disconnected. It usually will reconnect but not always. I shouldn<U+2019>t be woken up by this issue. It is a brand new monitor and there is no reason for the cameras to <U+201C>disconnect<U+201D> on the middle of the night."
"2183","1","Absolute garbage.  Do not buy this product.  Being tech savvy, I dismissed most of the bad reviews regarding this product as simple user error.  However, this was wrong, and I should have listened.The 1st month this product worked fine.  The buttons on the monitor are a bit unresponsive, and the nighttime IR picture is worse than the cheap, 4 year old Motorola set we already had, but these things are livable.  Getting into the 2nd month is when we started to have issues.  The monitor would lose connection to the camera causing the dreaded beeping noise, and to make things worse, most every time the camera itself would also beep twice.  I can understand the monitor sounding when it loses connection, but the camera?  Which engineers had that bright idea?  Obviously, folks that didn't have kids.  We are into the 3rd month of use, and I want to stop the monitor into the ground on a daily basis.  Without fail, one or both of the cameras lose connection, sometimes multiple times a day, and often in the middle of the night.  We have a baby that keeps us up at night enough as it is, and don't need what should be a helpful tool chiming in as well.Please do not skip over or dismiss any of the previous reviews warning about this product.  They are true."
"2184","1","Don't waste your money. We had two replacements in 10 months, both went out for no reason. A baby monitor should at least be expected to last as long as your child is a baby."
"2185","2","Terrible night vision quality. Screen looks red at night and grainy. Stays on night vision even during the day unless in direct sunlight. Glitches and lags constantly even when not connected to Wi-Fi. Battery only last approx. 4 hours off the charger. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. Especially for the price, just go with a standard Summer Infant and buy a desperate small Wi-Fi camera to use when needed."
"2186","1","I went ahead to purchased the camera even though I read so many bad reviews I wanted to judge for myself and The camera is very nice in person I wanted to like it but it didn't work out for usthere is an annoying sound when you have the camera and monitor close together and its constantly loosing signal. we returned and got the infant optic DXR-8"
"2187","1","the unit work good of a day or two then the sound  failed apparently Motorola Knows  of the problem is very common and they will warranty  the part but for that kind of money  it sucksthe camera was great the hardware was super the support web  is allows updating and out for repair"
"2188","5","Nice upgrade from the previous Motorola we had.The screen resolution is great and we like the app functionality and it is great for anyone who is out of the house a lot and wants to feel connected."
"2189","1","Would not buy this product.  I have had problems from the beginning.  The monitor constantly lost connectivity.  I called and submitted tickets, but Motorola said to just wait for firmware updates.  The monitor also doesn't charge properly unless propped up at a certain angle.  The monitor will lose the power connection and will beep throughout the night - waking us AND THE BABY!  To top it all off the night vision doesn't work anymore.  I can't see the baby and the monitor beeps all night.  DO NOT BUY."
"2190","1","Package did not include power cord! The camera is already overpriced at a hundred bucks and they fail to provide a power source for the camera. The product description clearly shows that a power adapter is included. Completely unacceptable."
"2191","1","This is our 3rd baby monitor. We had a summer which was good, it just didn't get enough range from across the house. Then we went to the Samsung, which was good but it kept loosing the range as well even though it said it was 900 ft. We thought maybe we needed wifi since we couldn't get regular ones to just go through two bedroom walls across the house. We got this one and I literally cannot see my child in the infrared night vision! I cannot believe they have this bad of night vision actually. This is a baby monitor! You mostly only use it at night! Highly disappointed on our first night. Take it from someone who has had 3 different ones, buy Samsung and try to find it with wifi. Night vision was great on Samsung!"
"2192","3","I like it, but the monitor is not very durable.  It broke after one drop.  Also, it does not tilt down very far to see into the crib, so you will most likely need to mount it on the wall."
"2193","1","I purchased the Motorola MBP853CONNECT-2 Dual Mode Baby Monitor with 2 cameras and wifi viewing from Amazon.  We did this because of a couple things. We are previous Motorola Monitor users. In fact we have had the same Motorola monitor for 4 and half years and loved it. It went everywhere with us and were pleased in the viewing, sound, talk back, distance, you name it! Then we had another child in January of this year and wanted a dual camera. Having been so happy with Motorola we began reviewing your dual camera options.  After reviewing all the products available, we decided on our current monitor.We are currently just shy of using this new monitor for 3 weeks. Both my wife and I are incredibly dissatisfied with our $300 purchase. There is extreme lag when trying to move the camera, between the monitor and the camera actually moving. Additionally, the talk back feature is slower on this new model than our last (We previously owned a Motorola single camera that we used for 4 and a half years). Previously we could push the button and wait just one second before talking. On this model, we have to wait 4-5 seconds to utilize the talk back.  Then when our voices are finally portrayed through the camera end into our child's room, it is completely distorted.  Our 4 year old is constantly telling us she cannot understand what we are saying.  Thus defeating the entire purpose of the talk back feature.Having had over a four year gap between our purchases we were expecting to receive a monitor with substantially higher technology and have been extremely dissatisfied."
"2194","1","I read all of the negative reviews and still decided to purchase this product. The handheld monitor is completely nonfunctional. Some electronic devices live for years and even decades but evidently not if made by Motorola. After fewer than just 11 weeks after the birth of our child without a functioning baby monitor.Please, please do yourself a favor and do not purchase this. You are better off not having a baby monitor at all so you at least aren't relying on such a poor device for the safety of your child."
"2195","5","Selected this baby monitor for the new grandson after reviewing everything available.  My daughter loves it, easy install, easy to use, gives them everything they need to monitor the little ones with confidence."
"2196","3","I bought this camera specifically so I can view the feed on my phone.  I loved the feed on the parent set but I never got it to work on my phone despite communicating with customer service.  Don't bother with this camera"
"2197","4","I love this system, one improvement i would like to have available is the option to not automatically turn down the volume after a short period of time. I understand the reason for it but if i want it to be loud i can only do that for a short window of time."
"2198","1","I was so happy to receive this item. A mother<U+2019>s worry has no end. It worked very well for about a week. The camera has never been able to hold a charge so it constantly has to be plugged in where ever you<U+2019>re using it. Which is a little inconvenient, but I could manage. Now the camera won<U+2019>t stay on at all. I<U+2019>m not sure if this item is just poorly made or if I got the one that should have never left the factory. I spent quite a bit of money on something that doesn<U+2019>t work and I am not pleased."
"2199","1","I initially liked this product, and overlooked the annoying beeping while the monitor was trying to find the camera each night, or the glitches the screen seemed to have on a regular basis. But now, after less than 6 months of regular nightly use of the sound option (not even leaving the screen lit up!) the monitor has died completely without warning. It is definitely not worth the money if the product will not even last for over a year."
"2200","5","I love that I can get on it while not at home and my babies are sleeping and their daddy is home or my husband can look at my babies while he is at work at night. Only down fall is Hubble takes forever for the cameras to load while on the phone but I also love having the parent unit because my phone shuts off all apps at a certain time in the middle of the night."
"2201","4","We love this monitor. Only down side is it doesn't tilt up and down very much so you need to place on a surface close to the crib that's not too high up. Overall, great picture, sound and quality."
"2202","4","I purchased this unit roughly 7 months ago. This unit has every option for connectivity and quality which could be offered. Both DFSS and WiFi connectivity for the inhome parent unit and away from the home using the Internet. This is why I purchased it. I know there are many poor reviews on this although this may be due user error or an unwillingness to work through support.Out of the box this is fairly simple to setup IF you follow the directions. The parent unit is already associated with the camera(s) in the box. Setting up the WiFi may be easy if you have good signal to the camera (mine have 3 bars). If your modem is in the basement and you are putting cameras on second floor, grab a Belk in WiFi extender at Walmart for the first floor as I have done.I purchased from Amazon and here is the story:the first unit I bought, the parent unit when the screen was off, it would turn on automatically after an hour (exactly an hour) and the auto shutoff would not kick in after this. This was an obvious battery waster or annoyance if trying to sleep next to it. I had Amazon Prime and returned it, same problem with the new unit (which is when I figured out through thorough testing the exact hour shut off time). Others who reviewed may have thought this was the ""turns on randomly"" complaint; no randomness about it.To Motorola support I went; they were very prompt and went through the expect troubleshooting but did not resolve. Knowing this was a systemic issue and how much the product offered I was not giving up. Motorola sent me a replacement (yes for $20, although this is for a first replacement, any further are free). This replacement had the same issue. Soo, I had them dig deeper and it turned out all of the units they had shipped, Amazon included, we're made within 2 months of each other. The tech tried one more unit replacement which was made a year later...BOOM, that unit worked.With so patience and perseverance, we now have a perfectly great working unit which has worked on the parent unit and phone app fantastically. The Hubble app has had many fixes and enhancements since and is much more solid.All in all, if you do find the issues above, call Motorola and have them ship you a new one. I only gave this 4 stars because I think Motorola SHOULD be proactively recalling the older, bad units instead of just losing the business through returns and dissatisfied customers. But the unit works great, once the issues were resolved and no complaints."
"2203","5","My grand daughter received it for when she came home from the hospital with the baby, The baby is now almost a year and half and the  Monitor works great.Thank you so much."
"2204","1","I've gone through 2 of these monitors in a year, save yourself the hassle and just find another one to purchase. I love the features like wi-fi a.d multi camera capabilities, but if you move it around the house and charge it there's more of a likely good it will stop taking a charge because of where you plug it in gets damaged from plugging and unplugging it. So frustrated and my return window closed 3 weeks ago, go figure!!!"
"2205","1","Terrible product. Both the camera and the viewing monitor won't 'connect' to their respective power cables after a few months of use. You have to hold them in place with tape at just the right angle to even work. Super frustrating when it goes out at night. Warranty is terrible and requires you to ship it for repair at your own expense for them to take a look and even then they may or may not fix it."
"2206","1","Internal Batteries are extremely hard to get to.  My battery died after one year.  Other models are much easier to replace.  I bought another model after this one broke."
"2207","1","The worst Baby monitor ever. Save your money please. This product is really garbage. After one month of purchase was not working. I bought it back in September by October the volume doesn't work. And it won't charge. Along with many other malfunctions. I paid way too much money for this crap. Will never get another Motorola product again. Do NOT BUY FROM JUST RIGHT. I believe they sell used products."
"2208","5","After returning 2 iBaby units and getting the Motorola MBP854CONNECT, I've found the Motorola to be far superior. It comes with a monitor, and the Hubble app is great and easy for everyone (Android and iPhone) to use. The listening and speaker functions work really well (at least to the point you can understand people) and while there is sometimes a delay, I don't blame the device, that is simply the state of the technology.I'm convinced these devices fall into one of two categories: ""hard line"" versions that come with dedicated monitors that usually have four or five star reviews but you can't view them on your smart devices. The other category is the smart device capable system that have lower reviews for two reasons:1. In the case of the iBaby, the product is really just inferior and the product quality isn't there2. The very nature of setting up and working with apps can be daunting, causing a lot of negative reviews spurred by people having trouble setting up the devices. I have no complaints about the Motorola."
"2209","1","After few months of use, the product stoppedworking. The cables never connected well and now one of them doesn<U+2019>t work anymore. The monitor doesn<U+2019>t charge anymore, so I can<U+2019>t turn it on.It<U+2019>s disappointed, I paid an expressive amount for this product, and now I can<U+2019>t find techinical support in Brazil to fix the problem."
"2210","5","Works very good, the control of the tilt by phone (hubble) and on the screen works very good, the quality is great."
"2211","2","The Wifi capability was the main reason we chose this video monitor but it's a 50/50 chance if it will work on a given night. Also the video quality has become consistently worse over the first year of use. At this point our son is barely recognizable on the monitor. We contacted Motorola three weeks ago but have yet to hear back from them."
"2212","3","We love this unit but have had multiple issues with it. Temperature reading are off and the video feed (handheld unit) continually cuts out. First one we ordered, the sound level bar didn<U+2019>t work and we returned it for another of the same. If you<U+2019>re looking for clear video, the handheld unit isn<U+2019>t great. The online Hubble is much better video."
"2213","3","Works fine, but my last one crapped out after only a year-and-a-half. At this price point you expected to work for 5 or 6 years"
"2214","1","This is the second one I purchased and it has now failed as well.  First one I owned, the monitor stopped charging.  No matter what I did, when it was plugged in the monitor would not charge.  Now on the second unit that I have only had since January, the monitor just simply stopped working.  Last night I went to take the monitor when it was time to go to bed and it was blank.  Nothing works.  Do NOT buy this product as it will eventually fail.  There are plenty of other options out there but skip this Motorola brand."
"2215","5","Easy to set up to hand held device and Hubble app on phone. I wish there could be a split screen with the 2 monitors, but it does rotate between the 2."
"2216","1","I hate this baby monitor. It has never worked properly (the buttons don't register my touch most of the time so I end up cursing at it and mashing buttons) and even when it is working well it's clunky, cumbersome, and slow. The stand on the back is tiny, so the monitor constantly falls over. The parent unit is enormous and doesn't fit into pockets if you are doing chores around the house. I hate this thing so much. I wish I had never bought it."
"2217","3","this is my second monitor of the same model. after only a few months there appears to be a short in the monitor where the charging cord plugs into the monitor. Very frustrating for such an expensive model."
"2218","4","The handheld monitor is already ""glitchy"" and we have only had this for two months. I do like that when I'm away on trips I can use the app from my phone and see my sweet child snoozing."
"2219","1","I've purchased this item just when my baby was born. At first, I really liked. But after less than 2 months, the monitor (parent unit) Just wouldn't charge anymore! I've tried different kinds of battery and also switched with the camera charge, and it just wouldn't work. So in the end, I couldn't start the monitor anymore! I've tried to send it to technical assistance but they said that this wouldn't work anymore. I'm very disappointed."
"2220","1","This monitor is terrible!!The monitor takes a million trit's to catch the signal from the camera... each try results in a loud BEEP on the monitor  AND the camera... which WAKE UP THE BABY!!!!!TERRIBLE,  DON'T PURCHASE!!"
"2221","1","To be honest It's not worth the price! First the communication between the monitor and the cam is really bad, moving the cam by the monitor can result sometime into weird moment when the monitor will be acting stupid and get jammed.It takes forever to pair with the cam whenever you turn it on to use.The quality I thought it's HD !! Seems it's not at allThe most important thing is the sound !! The sound is soooo low that it's impossible to hear when I watch TVMy opinion, it's not worth it at all and if I knew I wouldn't get it even if it's half price cuz the functionality is zero...the simple ones are the best"
"2222","1","We loved this camera and used it for two years. Then everything started malfunctioning. We thought we would give it another try and purchased the same one two weeks ago. Well it<U+2019>s already malfunctioning and losing signal and basically not working. We can<U+2019>t return it bc we threw the box away. Hoping Motorola will help us out since we have already spent over $300 in their products and they<U+2019>re malfunctioning."
"2223","1","A good friend talked us into getting this monitor despite the poor Amazon reviews. Big mistake. The wireless range is awful and the battery life is even worse. The only good thing about this monitor is the quality of the picture on the display. Problem with that is the touch buttons don't always seem to register. So we have a hard time moving the cameras around. There has to be a million better products out there."
"2224","4","The 1st one was busted out of the box, this one works well but the battery doesn't last long on its own. All in all a good unit that works well but isn't the best made and could be improved upon"
"2225","1","I had my hopes up for this as it has wifi connection. But honestly so disappointed. We got this 5 month before our baby was born. She is 8 months and the monitor doesn<U+2019>t work anymore. So i have to have it on my phine or tablet. Which if it includes a monitor it should be good. Battery started to mess up only like 2 momths after she was born. And now im having to look for another device."
"2226","2","At first it worked fine, however, after about two months i was having difficulty connecting with my I phone. If it works it would have been a great product."
"2227","3","Question for manufacturer: My toddler stepped on the cord for the second monitor and bent the metal part before we ever used it, and now I need to replace it as the second child has arrived! I'd like to buy a replacement cord from Motorola and not some 3rd party seller. Where can I buy the power adapter for the camera-to-wall? Not having any luck on Google! All results offer cord for older model."
"2228","1","After much research, I bought a Motorola branded electronic baby sitter (model MBP854-dual). Less than 6 months of use, I can no longer keep the volume of the monitor in due to interference noise. In addition, the power supply connector does not connects perfectly on the monitor. What can Motorola do? I live in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. What can Motorola do for your customer?"
"2229","1","Terrible baby monitor !! This is my second Motorola baby monitor, so since I had a great experience with  MBP36 I decided to buy the new model for my newborn. Range is awful! It beeps all the time and the wi fi feature takes too long to connect ! If you really need a wi fi baby monitor, please buy a Nest Cam. As regular video baby monitors I bought an infant optics and I<U+2019>m satisfied with it."
"2230","3","Monitor works great, as does the app on my android phone. My only complaint is that the charging port on the monitor has become loose or something, and I can no longer charge the monitor. This is highly frustrating. I'm working on trying to figure out how to contact the seller now, to see how to take care of this problem."
"2231","3","Night time vision is ok, about 3 feet away, anything else is dark and grainy. I ended up returning this for the dxr8 and couldn't be happier. I do miss having the wifi option."
"2232","3","They show great quality buy of a delay in showing up and voice. Didn't like having to subscribe to subscription so returned"
"2233","1","So disappointed with this monitor! It works on and off for no specific reason eventhough it was brand new, we got it in September.Suddenly, the camera charger stopped working, the screen wouldn't connect to the cam for no reason.and the Hubble app didn't work! I could not even connect my phone to the cam.Wish I could return it! Motorola u failed this time sorry -__-"
"2234","5","Very nice monitor.  Gave it to my son and daughter in law.  They are using it and I get to log into with the app and watch the baby sleep  i'm in  another state.  Love technology."
"2235","2","there is not even 1 one that I bought this and the camera does not turn on untill I keep holding the cable and trying to held it in a certain position. That means, the connect cable entrance plug in the camera is malfunctioning, has a poor/bad contact."
"2236","3","Bought this in December and the sound just stopped working. I've turned it on and off, checked the volume and nothing. The lights blink red but no sound.Edit*** customer service was helpful, once I went through the troubleshooting and reset, it's been working fine."
"2237","2","Product was easy to set up.  Hard to mount on the wall.  No hardware included.  Mostly works in the night mode even if the room light is on.  Within 3 months, the monitor connection port started malfunctioning and now I cannot charge the monitor.  It advertises free Hubble app for motorolla but app is useless unless you can use it to monitor the cameras.  For monitoring they charge you about 30 dollars a year.  It is free only for one week to try."
"2238","1","This worked great for a couple of weeks.  Now the camera won't connect to the monitor.  I'm so angry I spent so much $ and now have no video monitor."
"2239","1","It was the biggest mistake we made purchasing this baby monitor. It worked fine for about 2 months and then the screen started to drop connection to the camera when in use (even though the two units were just a wall apart). At this point, the whole thing became useless. Since then it<U+2019>s been very frustrating trying to monitor our baby with it. I wish I could give a 0 star."
"2240","5","Such a nice monitor! wifi capabilities and large clear screen."
"2241","5","very goodThe sound is excellent and the picture is good"
"2242","1","This has stopped working completely. The monitor consistently says that it can not find a camera. I have tried everything. Resetting it doesn't work, unplugging it doesn't work and the manual is useless. I'm going to look into calling the manufacturer and sending it back to them."
"2243","2","First impression:GoodVideo quality is good.Setup was easy.BadHorrible lag even on a local network. Sometimes video lags as much as 30 seconds.Notifications/alerts lag by 15-30 seconds. Sometimes a couple of minutes. (just based on a couple of hours usage)With these issues, it is not a good baby monitor. I don't understand why it is sooo slow on local network"
"2244","2","I agree with other reviews that the connection was not reliable. The app hardly ever worked if I tried to go outside for a run while baby was sleeping. Also, when it was on and working properly, it used up all of the bandwidth in our house so we were not able to use our internet AT ALL when it was in use. Camera angles were very limited even though the head looks like it should have good movement and range."
"2245","5","Works perfectly. Easy to setup. Next version I would like to see the option to save camera angles so I don't have to pan as much."
"2246","4","Spent lots and lots of time checking cameras for the baby room.  Plain n simple.  This gets the job done.  I could probably compile a list of things to fix. But overall.  It works.  And works as it should.  Biggest problem is having to reconnect to the wifi when it decides to randomly disconnect on its own."
"2247","4","Great camera, doesn't always stay connnected but otherwise a great buy."
"2248","1","Review edit: one camera stopped working and now the unit makes a buzzing sound. Will be contacting conpany for replacement or refund."
"2249","3","Although the convenience of this camera is great, the night image is not. I expected it to be similar to my other Motorola camera/monitor but unfortunately this cameras night vision lacks ""vision"". It is too dark."
"2250","5","Really nicely done.  Simple to install, works perfectly.  Both portable display or on my iPhone.  I purchased a different product and ended up dumping it in the trash.  Not this one.  Big thumbs up."
"2251","1","Worked once. Then it froze. Now it won't reconnect. Buggy, slow, awful. It can never connect. Our wifi is very fast, we've never had trouble with anything before."
"2252","1","I want to return this camera as it does not meet product expectations. You can't hear anything, the image freezes up, and it constantly disconnects from the monitor even when in close proximity. The app is also very glitchy. This is the most expensive monitor in the market and does not even fulfill its basic functions. We would like our money back so we can buy a baby monitor that actually works."
"2253","5","Have been using for over a year and works great!"
"2254","4","For a baby monitor it is exactly what I wanted. Pan, zoom, motilones camaras, plays Lulabys, nigh vision, and I can use the app to check in my little one when I am not home. No baby monitor is perfect you can see. Any you can see that they are breathing. Sound is a little delayed but I love it. They could do with an updated parant unit I feel like it does not match the quality of the camera, because when I look at with my phone it is amazing quality!"
"2255","1","Do not Buy this device! We bought this as a baby monitor and it has been nothing but a disappointment. I have very fast internet and wifi running this even next to the router and there is always lag. More recently the device now drops video for about half a second every few min. I have the latest firmware and app version available. Still didnt help. I just moved to a new house with a new router. I performed a factory reset on the device as per the instructions for moving locations. I get the camera working and after about 5 min or when moving it to a different room, the camera doesnt turn back on but instead it flashes red to be setup again. It can no longer be connected. This device is failing on me and I bought this in Nov 2015 and it hasnt even been a year and it appears to be bricked. Solution: Save $150 + dollars and use your iPhone and iPad with a baby monitor app that does all the same features as this for $3.Sadly I lost all my money since Motorola doesnt seem to care much. Motorola, if you read this, please replace this item. Better yet, just refund and return it."
"2256","3","the interface on the monitor is very tedious. it seems to have a mind of its own and attempts to change inputs from one camera to the other, and since it's expandable to up to 4 cameras, when it sees there's no 3rd or 4th camera, it emits a loud ""BEEEP!"" that's annoying. toggling the camera views on and off eventually locks it in place. the app takes a while to load, but there seems to be some form of security around it, keeping hackers etc out of video of your kid. temperature alerts are nice, although my camera is mounted upside-down and it seems as though the thermometer is registering higher temps because of it. in the end, it was the only baby monitor i saw that had both a monitor, 2 cameras, and an accompanying App for iPhone that matched the price point. the microphone does not have a large dynamic range either. what i mean is that while you can hear people talking well, and you can hear crying etc, the mic will fail when the crying reaches a high volume, and this will cause clipping or peaking on the mic. on the monitor side, you'll hear a VERY annoying crackle while the baby is crying at max volume. it'll certainly wake you up. the crackle only goes away when you mute the monitor or the crying stops, naturally.  turning volume up and down is at least two steps into the menu on the monitor, would rather dedicated buttons, but what are you gunna do.Also, why the hell would this line offer a camera with a single, larger screen monitor that does not support multiple cameras, when the smaller monitor does? why why? i wanted to give you money for the upgraded screen, and i CAN'T?? oh well."
"2257","5","This is a great monitor to use if you want to be able to watch your baby on your cell phone from work. I love the capability of being able to log into my camera, and look around the nursery when I'm not there."
"2258","3","The night time video is generally poor quality. The instruction manual provides limited information about connecting other devices. Seems like the designer missed an opportunity for increased usability by not using illuminated buttons. It's pretty hard to work the dedicated parent unit night in a dark bedroom."
"2259","1","Hubble app  only works for a day then doesn't work anymore.  Also the monitor is made with the worst UI I've ever used."
"2260","1","If I could give it 0 stars I would, this product is horrible. the monitor disconnects during the night because the cable doesn't stick, it starts beeping during the night so even if the baby is sound asleep you won't get to sleep. When contacted Motorola they never responded so I am stuck with this terrible product. Waste of money!"
"2261","1","The videos is nice but the sound is too low, meaning that at the highest volume you won<U+2019>t hear anything unless there is absolute silence at the house.Reception between floors is very weakMy suggestion is to buy a different monitor with higher sound volume and stronger reception signal."
"2262","3","Can only use one of the monitors that comes with it per camera.  Can't have both connected and on at the same time."
"2263","3","I was able to keep an eye on things at home from afar. Picture quality was good. You can pinch zoom to get close ups. You can pan and tilt, see things in the dark.Biggest gripe is the long delay time. When accessing the camera feed, to pan and tilt.... there was quite a bit of delay and lag before action happened"
"2264","1","Stay away! The charger plug won't work unless you jiggle it and hold it in place and even if it's off it turns itself on when we barely MOVE it! Then we then turn it off and it keeps turning itself back on. Then the process repeats AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!! A waste of money"
"2265","5","Works very well. We haven<U+2019>t had any issues. I love being able to see my baby no matter where I am."
"2266","2","Our unit has  an issue with making a beeping noise when unplugging and letting the screen turn off.  So we have to keep the unit plugged in at all times or risk having a beeping noise from the unit and in the baby's room.  Not sure  who to contact to resolve the issue but disappointed in the unit.  We were one of the first to buy when they came online and bought it based off of Motorolas reputation and we should have waited."
"2267","1","Please don<U+2019>t buy this monitor! It has been nothing but a problem since day one"
"2268","1","This is hands down the worse thing I bought for our baby. The battery life is horrible, the cord stop working to charge it, it randomly beeps and freezes, and the range is not good.  I ended up buying a simple sound monitor since this one wasn<U+2019>t reliable and now my son is only 8months and it is completely shot. Do not buy this."
"2269","4","Great picture and sound. WiFi connectivity seems to be a little spotty. We had the cameras hooked up in the same room as the modem and router and it rarely worked. The Camera in the bedroom, not near the modem and router worked well. When we swapped cameras in each room we had the same issues.  Hubble app is a nice option for when you are away from home."
"2270","1","after using it for 6 months I highly do NOT recommend this camera! Sound stopped working after 1 month of use, now, charger doesn't work, I am using a charger from my UE MEGABOOM (a sound system). Sent an email to Motorola 4 days ago, and no answer at all! I will never buy another Motorola baby monitor again!"
"2271","5","Very happy with this purchase, very easy to set up, I used two different ones before this one with my other two but I will say this is the best baby monitor. I don<U+2019>t usually write reviews but I felt like it was a must to write a review about this one, since I really liked it."
"2272","1","If I could give this 0 stars I would Motorola should be absolutely embarrassed by putting out such an inferior product. Everyone from the designers to, creators, to the ones who approved this for release should be FIRED!!! I can<U+2019>t even list one good thing about this completely awful product."
"2273","2","I never got a good audio"
"2274","1","This isn't the second one we have bought. The charging spot for the micro USB breaks very easily. The one I have right now is already breaking after a month of use. If you can't unplug and replug this in, what is the point?"
"2275","5","so far it works good. The image quality is good and the wifi option is really useful."
"2276","5","Sure I've made the right choice!Best baby monitor EVER!I highly recommend!Picking up a baby monitor is a hard task, but after researching I found this one. It has more features than any other!!!"
"2277","2","It served our goal of seeing our baby, but the night vision never worked. We could never see her without a light in the room. The charging cable also eventually broke completely from wear and tear<U+2014>not a very stable design. We can still use from our phones but not always as convenient."
"2278","1","Do not buy it!!!My camera stopped working 4 months after buying it and there is NO support for costumers. I have sent e-mails several times and no one answered me.The ideia when buying this kind of device is help, not to waste money and time trying to solve this kind of problem (that is not acceptable after only 4 months of use).Will someone give me a position now?????Thanks!"
"2279","2","Unless your rooms are on the same floor, this monitor will not stay connected. I like the features and we are swapping out for another Motorola model with a longer range."
"2280","5","working excellent"
"2281","4","Very good camera, the monitor would be the one that's bringing down the whole package. It doesn't get a signal further than 5m more or less, and very often it's slow to react to move the angles of the camera."
"2282","1","Randomly turns off even with a fully charged battery. Randomly un-syncs from the cameras. Never works in scan mode. Ideal if you would like to have no idea what your child is doing. I contacted Motorola and after a lot of negotiating, they sent me a new parent console. It has ALL of the same issues as the original."
"2283","5","Great product!!"
"2284","4","This camera works great for viewing our LO during the day and at night. But after the update the controller became very hard to use, when you want to pan or tilt we would have to hold the button down for 10sec before it does anything and by than it moved it across the room ...If your able to manually move your camera around its best to do it that way.ePairing it to the Hubble app was a breeze and the HD quality is a +If they fix the software for the controller I would consider getting more cameras."
"2285","2","Worked good for the first month or so, now everytime try to use it keeps cutting out so it works for a few minutes and then beeps because it says ""no connection"". Our wifi is still the same and that has been checked. This is not very reliable, as with it continues to keep cutting out, cannot trust it anymore."
"2286","1","I bought the Motorola MBP854CONNECT Dual Mode Baby Monitor 5 months ago and the monitor is already having trouble charging, I have to wiggle and adjust the cord to be at the exact angle to get it to charge, otherwise it beeps incessantly. After 5 months of use, this is very disappointing and would not recommend this product."
"2287","2","Loses wi-fi connection pretty regularly, which requires switching the camera off/on to reboot.  This requires entering the childs room, so what's the point?  Other wise, it works OK."
"2288","3","Sluggish performance, not terrible but not great. The app is pretty dreadful."
"2289","3","We love our camera, but after only a small handful of months we notice that the cord does not plug into the camera properly anymore. I believe it<U+2019>s because the way the cord is designed, it<U+2019>s too heavy. We<U+2019>re constantly having to fanagle the cord so the camera works. Other than that, the quality is great."
"2290","5","Perfect for our family. Husband is a commercial pilot and away from home for days at a time. He now can use the motorola ap to connect with baby and wife in real time. It is delayed a little but still does what we hoped it would do. He is even able to move the camera with the ap. in order to see around the nursery."
"2291","2","Not ideal if you're looking for good night vision"
"2292","5","Works great. The visual quality is great and the app has worked well if I""m roaming or connected to wifi at work. This was definitely priced well and works great."
"2293","2","All the features are good. Overall it does a pretty good job. The iPhone app is good enough. There's only one BIG problem:Sometimes both: the monitor and the iPhone app freeze the video on a still image; the sound seems to transmit ok, but a still image is a HUGE problem.Not recommended!"
"2294","1","Terrible product. Doesn't hold a charge for more then a few hrs and this started right after we started using it, also shuts off randomly and this has happened alot during the might. Tried calling tech support and never was able to get ahold of anyone after being on hold for a hour."
"2295","3","The Camera is serviceable, but not does not provide consistent HD results. The Camera *is* a HD camera, however there does appear to be significant latency spiking when connecting to Motorola's servers when there are not other network issues.  If you like your HD images inconsistently, supplemented by low quality images, this is the camera for you. It works, you can use it to monitor rooms - just manage your expectations."
"2296","4","The camera quality is great but the music that comes over the camera is God awful."
"2297","1","My camera cord is already not working and baby is not even 5 months. Camera disconnects all the time. The cord for the monitor is also broken. The monitor turns on and off by itself all the time and this is what I'm supposed to be using to watch my newborn. I just can't rely on it."
"2298","1","I should of listen to the reviews... Bad quality image, keeps loosing the signal from the cameras and Motorola Customer service SUCKS!!!"
"2299","1","Both charging cables weren't working properly by the time the baby monitor arrived. And after only one week of use, they stopped working at All. And I couldn't return the product because I leave in Brazil and bought the baby monitor from a trip.Really disappointed with the product, because it was really expensive."
"2300","1","Far too expensive for what<U+2019>s proven to be a bad product. Power port loose causing disconnection between monitor and camera, which of course makes the product worthless. User interface is not intuitive and is clunky and slow. Expected far more for my money"
"2301","5","Highly recommended baby monitor"
"2302","5","Bought this to 'monitor' our 94 year old mother.  It is quiet, clear and exactly what we had hoped for. Very good low light image. (In low light it is B&W, but very clear)"
"2303","1","O doesn<U+2019>t work very bad"
"2304","1","I bought the baby monitor MBP854 and i received the model MBP853. I need my money!"
"2305","1","Clearly the people making this piece of crap don't have children. The video literally beeps all night long, supposedly when it drops signal. It has weaken me 3x tonight, as compared to the 2x my 4 day old has been up.  This is not all though:The sound is awful. I actually heard the baby crying in her room and it wasn't coming though the monitor. Yea volume was up all the way. A stupid timer pops up in red taking up the bottom of the screen and covering up your ability to see the video. Video quality is poor. The user interface is awful. Not easy to switch between cameras. It should be a button on the outside to go back and forth, not having to go through a long menu. I could go on, but hopefully this is enough to convince you never to buy this product. Save yourself the frustration and lack of sleep."
"2306","1","The monitor loses connectivity frequently, resulting in a very loud beeping. My husband and I have had many nights when the monitor woke us up rather than the baby. Very disappointing, especially given the price."
"2307","5","Synced quickly and easily with my existing camera set up. Very happy with purchase!"
"2308","2","There is a delay on the monitor, which is frustrating. The app needs a lot of work put into it. Every time you move it to a new wifi you have to re-sync your phone to it. I expected more from Motorola."
"2309","5","Love this monitor! The picture is very clear and the sound adjustment you get to choose is perfect. If you choose to put it on silent there is a color code thing that lets you know if baby is making noise (green) and if they're crying (red) which I found very useful."
"2310","4","It is not as HD as it seems to be in description, anyways good product"
"2311","1","Worst baby monitor ever.  When our baby was crying you cannot even hear it on the monitor.  However you could hear him from upstairs.  Range of downward angle of the camera is bad.  Very bad design.  Do not buy.  This is getting returned"
"2312","4","I am a bit of an expert on security cameras so when buying a baby monitoring camera, had a bit of a high standard.I have been very impressed with this camera and monitor.  Its not perfect in every way, but it is largely good.Pros:1) Image quality is excellent. Plenty of Infrared lighting for good night time viewing and true to color in daylight.2) Sound quality is excellent. You can tell a cry from a whine from a grunt without issue3) No delay. More and more data being transmitted with these cameras means more chance for delay. Across our large home delay is less than .5 a second.Cons:1) Sound is a bit quiet. Not too quiet, but a bit quieter than I would prefer2) Hubble app never worked right. This is a minor issue."
"2313","5","Works great and allows me to keep an eye on my 92 year old mother while I am working.  It even allows my sister in NYC to watch her in NJ via a phone app.  Highly recommend."
"2314","5","Does everything I wanted it to do and more! I love that there's an app for my phone so I can see my baby when I'm at work and he's home with daddy."
"2315","1","This camera is not capable of being reset. I<U+2019>m now unable to connect to my network since I need to reset the camera. I would not buy any camera from Motorola."
"2316","2","Camera works good with included monitor. But online app doesn<U+2019>t work ((("
"2317","1","Horrible! How do I return? I'm very upset with this. The wifi app ran out of the trial and now i need to pay monthly? I cant pair it with any other app. But the worst part is that the battery doesn't last on the monitor off the charger! this was not cheap at all either. wth??"
"2318","1","Inoperable. Supporting App crashes all the time. Such a shame that Motorola can't even make a properly functioning cam."
"2319","2","Sound stopped working after only 6 month use. It can be very difficult to plug in in the dark. My old one we just set onto a stand to charge it."
"2320","1","Video Quality Poor, Cameras kept dropping signal (even when next to the display unit), app was very slow often camera did not load for streaming, colour was very off, my wife's brunette hair appeared bright blue. Overall this monitor is not worth the price."
"2321","1","This product is a joke! We tried to use this in our single level house for our two babies. We quickly found out that the range of the cameras is less than 1000 feet and will not work if you have walls. So unless you are leaving in a small studio apartment this is not the right product for you."
"2322","2","I was really disappointed in this product. The picture quality on the monitor ins't great and some of the features (temperature, etc) never worked. The battery life is really nothing and it had to be plugged in the whole time. The charge eventually just stopped working so withing 10 months the whole unit didn't function."
"2323","4","I really liked the electronic nanny, the image on the monitor is excellent, all the features very good, but the only thing that did not please me totally was the sound quality, I found it very low, and I have difficulty listening to my baby"
"2324","1","I was really excited for this monitor because of the two cameras and split screen option but when I received it, it only had 1 camera in it and I paid for 2. I hate that I didn't get to try it out to give an actual review on how it works."
"2325","4","good product, connect both monitor and phone at the same time, but i did not find any may to reduce the resolution, and there is 2-4 second delay"
"2326","1","This monitor has been a disappointment on several fronts but I'll list my top three complaints.First, it will randomly and spontaneously lose communication between the hand held device and the camera.  The device is kept well within the required range but it will just won't work consistently.Second, the thermometer reading is several degrees inaccurate.  I've done a couple control tests with other thermometers and this one varied by 3-4 degrees.  The other thermometers reflected the same temps.Third, the phone app works even less than the handheld.  My iPhone can be on either wifi or LTE and maybe the monitor connects half the time.  Very disappointing.Also, part of the reason I bought this was the Motorola name.  Other devices of theirs that I've used (mainly radios) all worked well.  This thing is junk."
"2327","1","This camera started to have lot of issues after 6 months of use and it came scratches in corners of monitor. Now I wonder if they game me and used one or refurbished. Never again"
"2328","1","This is the 3rd Baby monitor  I have had to get in under a year. They keep breaking and every time you have to get a new monitor you have to get a camera. Out of no where my new monitor that  I just bought two weeks ago stopped working."
"2329","5","Works well. Confusing at first but I love it"
"2330","1","The new baby monitor is not working well . Sound does not work. I can not hear anything. Bad acquisition"
"2331","4","Great product for a baby monitor.  Haven't had any issues.  Clear picture for day and night."
"2332","1","If I could rate this 0 stars, I would. I<U+2019>ve had this monitor for less than a year and the sound has gone out multiple times. The monitor screen constantly flickers and the color is off."
"2333","1","I hate this monitor! I actually purchased this monitor from Target not Amazon, but I wanted to add a review to warn other potential buyers this is not the monitor you want! We spent $300 on this crap and I've dealt with the problems for so long I can't even return it. The monitor disconnects ALL THE TIME, and it's not our wifi. The monitor stays on throughout the night in our room and all of a sudden you hear a really loud beeping because it's decided to disconnect! (That's REALLY annoying in the middle of the night!) What's worse is that this now means I have to ninja crawl into the baby's nursery to disconnect the camera from the wall and plug it back in without waking her up. I hate this camera so much and it gives me this problem ALL THE TIME! It was so expensive but not worth it at all. Sound quality is fine to me. Image quality is fine, it is a bit grainy and it does lag a little but that doesn't bother me near as much as the constant disconnection. Don't buy this product."
"2334","5","Great product!"
"2335","2","So disappointed!  This was recommended to me from a friend and I love the idea that I can use my phone to check in on my little one as well as the handheld.  First off I rarely use the app...duh on my part I am usually home when she is sleeping and have the handheld!  But why I am giving the two stars is that the handheld is proving to be terrible. 6 weeks in and already it is having trouble staying connected to the camera. When the screen times out it beeps like it is disconnected but I can still hear my little one, clearly it is still connected. Other downside I did not consider is the camera placement. In order to see into the crib need to mount above looking in, not so great considering my crib is by a window and the window treatments make it impossible to hang within arms reach. Have the option to ceiling mount but then can't turn the camera off during the day which causes overheating.  To top it all off the friend who recommended it way back when I registered for it just told me hers stopped working after 13 months for no obvious reason.Love the features wish it lived up to my expectations"
"2336","5","Love it"
"2337","1","Bought this in haste when my Summer Infant cord stopped charging and I was desperate for a quick replacement but I'm very disappointed in this product. The highest volume setting is still nearly impossible to hear our baby unless she was really crying loudly, and the image quality is very poor, especially the nighttime video. If I could I would return this monitor."
"2338","5","Nice product"
"2339","5","Great Product"
"2340","1","I was hoping this was going to be the answer to a small problem we have but the product is worthless. The cameras do not stay connected to the base and viewing from our phones or tablets is horrible. Most of the time we could not connect to either camera via phone/tablet and the base would constantly lose connection to both cameras. The picture is grainy and no where near 720 viewing. Motorola missed the mark on this one big time."
"2341","1","Do not get this product if you want to sleep. One of my cameras loses signal multiple times throughout the night and wakes me up with a beeping sound. The worst thing that can happen for a sleep deprived parent."
"2342","1","I regret having bought this. The connectivity is very, very poor through the monitor and the wifi feature to see the images through your mobile also doesn't work well. This has become simply useless at home, even though I tried very hard."
"2343","1","Doesn't last for a year.  USB port broke inside the camera with barely any use.  This is my second one and it doesn't last.  Look for a different product if you need to move the camera around."
"2344","1","Terrible. Cords stopped working.  It's not wireless.  I could never get it to connect to the app, which is the whole reason I bought it. And now almost a year after I got it. It completely stopped working."
"2345","3","My second Motorola baby monitor and once again the battery has issues. It won't charge fully and once it is running without being plugged in, the battery life is very short."
"2346","3","Screen broke after a couple of months. It's saving grace is that we can view it on our phones and tablets."
"2347","1","This monitor is awful. The camera never works. The charge cord does not stay in the monitor. Beeps for no reason in the middle of the night. I would never recommend that anyone purchase this monitor."
"2348","5","Bought it for my son so he could watch his newborn from work, love the smart app"
"2349","1","So we've been using this for about a month now. For the price this thing should be phenomenal. Its not. The night time picture isn't great. You can see fine, but it could be better. The older one we have is a lot better. I got this because I wanted remote viewing AND the monitor.This is NOT a HD camera, certainly not 720p.Remote viewing is hit or miss, sometimes it connects sometimes not.To sum up, for the asking price, this product doesn't meet the expectation.Edit/Update: Had to lower to 1 star, really disappointed with this.  After 6 months the base station stopped charging. Motorola is replacing it, but the fact that is broke is an indication of poor quality. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Also, the Web UI pretty much doesn't work. The mobile is pretty good, but the Web UI just times out."
"2350","5","This is perfect for our nursery!  It does everything we were hoping and you can log on with your Smartphone."
"2351","1","Extremely poor picture qualitySpotty service, motion detection is poor, rarely notifies me when motion is detectedI do not recommend purchasing this product"
"2352","1","The touchscreen keys don<U+2019>t always work and I struggle to get the camera to where I want it. The display is also delayed. I have to keep it plugged in the charge doesn<U+2019>t last long. I feel like for the money I could<U+2019>ve gotten something better ."
"2353","1","We had very bad luck with this product. battery life depletes too quickly and after 9 months it has developed a constant beeping noise coming from the parent unit. We spent too much on a monitor that has only been reliable for less that one year."
"2354","2","I bought this camera last year and only in February that I started to use. Unfortunately in just one month the sound is not working anymore all the time and I cannot trust to leave my baby in her room alone."
"2355","2","We<U+2019>ve had this a short time and the camera is already malfunctioning and not working."
"2356","5","Before I bought this, I saw all the reviews saying that the sound doesn't work and that the quality is bad; however, through all of my research, I had to go with my gut and I bought it. I have had it for about 2 months now and can honestly say that they work great and no other camera on the market comes close! I can even hear conversations going on two rooms over, if i turn the volume up high enough."
"2357","1","Cannot transmit sound clearly. I can barely hear baby crying downstairs. I have to buy another monitor just to make sure I can hear the sound."
"2358","4","Good item"
"2359","2","the signal cuts out a lot, especially in the middle of the night.  However, I have the same one in a different room, and its been working great for three years."
"2360","1","Very disappointed. The picture isn't that great and the night vision is atrocious especially for the price. Wouldn't pay half the cost for this. Also, the user interface of the monitor isn't as easy as other brands. I knew I was returning this within 1 hour of opening the package."
"2361","2","We haven<U+2019>t had the monitor a month and the volume no longer works, our second baby hasn<U+2019>t even arrived yet. We will be returning this monitor, we are 0-2 with Motorola, I think it<U+2019>s time to try a new brand."
"2362","3","1. The monitor is not very convenient, it does not always react to the buttons and hangs a couple of times.2. Videos can only be recorded in the cloud."
"2363","2","Better off with the old cheaper model. This one has a delay, doesn't have as strong of a signal and requires too many button presses to make routine adjustments/check"
"2364","3","Works well over Wi-Fi, with good video and sound quality. However, the baby monitor that accompanies it doesn't quite match it. Video quality is below par and the sound is too low, even at maximum volume. Also, the range that the monitor works is very disappointing.As far as other functions go, such as rotation, angle, microphone, room temp., etc. it works as expected."
"2365","1","Terrible night resolution; blurry picture, bad sound. Pan-Tilt controls can take minutes to react; video image took minutes to update through paper thin plaster walls (even if connected directly to the camera, not even over the internet). And then, there's the lack of VOX. Sound is barely audible. I was testing a $99 Infant Optics DXR-5 (and the more expensive DXR-8) monitor at the same time, which has VOX (only DXR-5) and picked up noise that the Motorola wouldn't. Screaming into the Motorola camera would sometimes send the sound several seconds delayed, but sometimes / most of the time it wouldn't send anything at all. Motorola monitors have the outstanding quality of consistent failure. To be clear: A $99 baby monitor will work better than this monitor."
"2366","4","Pairing the unit with a second camera was very easy. The app is user friendly as well. I like how you can customize the settings on each camera individually."
"2367","2","By the cost of the product I totally expected to have a better battery life, we need to charge it back everyday even using light set of configuration (less bright, less minutes with camera showing image, etc)."
"2368","1","i am sure that it has been used before  , the camera and screen is scratched , the charger wire is not organized and sealed as new wire . i am very disappointed"
"2369","3","The port for the battery is weak and can not hold the chargers in the unit properly xausing it to die and not stay charged its garbage. I have bought a new power cord and it only lasted a week"
"2370","1","Update a few months later (1:18 a.m.):My hatred and loathing of this device are visceral. If either Motorola or Amazon cared about parents, they would have every one of these destroyed and never sell one again. Maybe we should give them to terrorists as a new kind of torture. I HATE this thing.I hate this thing so very much. I hate it enough to write this review at 1:00 in the morning. For as much as it cost, I expect it to work. Any device that is meant for sleep-deprived parents to operate in the middle of their exhausted stupor needs to just work. The buttons don't work. The touch screen buttons don't work. I just friggin' hate this thing and resent it for making me lose even MORE sleep than I already am."
"2371","2","At first the Motorola MBP854 Connect seemed to work pretty well.  I have had it for about one month now and suddenly the pan and tilt will not work.  Every time you try to pan the camera using the monitor, it loses signal to the camera and it not only doesn't pan or tilt, the picture goes out for 30 seconds or more but then comes back in. I expected more from such an expensive baby monitor."
"2372","3","We previously had the summer infant video monitor but switched to this when we had a new baby and wanted to have an easy system with two cameras. The instruction manual is not included with the box (just a quick set up pamphlet) so I had to google the instructions.  The video quality at night is not nearly as good as our older Summer monitor (2 years old) despite it being on ""night vision"" mode.  In addition, our two year old broke the camera within a few days of us buying it and it no longer works - something made for watching kids shouldn't be so easy to break in 5 seconds if you turn your back on them!  I was not successful at connecting my iphone - although I only tried for 30 min because the camera broke the next day....  If we hadn't already broken it I would have considered returning it for something that was a little better quality viewing because I know it exists."
"2373","1","do not buy this!!!!!!Terrible sign, terrible image, it just does not work to watch over a baby in the next room."
"2374","1","First the charging cable stopped working. Then the volume went out so baby was screaming crying and WE HAD NO IDEA! Even though the volume was turned up all the way. Find a different monitor."
"2375","4","At the top of the price range for this product, imo this product is an overall very good. if it were cheaper by lets say, a reasonable 50$, it would have been excellent!!Other than price nothing wrong to say and provides a much needed piece of mind!"
"2376","1","Sound went off after 8 months of use."
"2377","2","Please contact me... the charger is damaged already after a month and a half of use and thw screen acts up"
"2378","1","Sound is very quiet. I have it turned all the way up and I can barely hear my daughter even if she is screaming. Also, 2 days ago it quit working. Camera says it's connected but it just sits on the Motorola screen like there is no camera connected. 4 months old and it already doesn't work (my daughter is 3 months so really it's only been used since she was born)."
"2379","5","This was my second one of these monitors as my toddler broke the first one."
"2380","1","one of the cameras I received was defective and keep getting unpaired."
"2381","3","The video transmitting has a boring delay, the video seems framed.The appearance of the product make me feel like I am holding a fake one, a pirate.There is a serious delay in the camera commands. Sometimes you have to press the button too much to achieve a movement."
"2382","1","This monitor is horrible! We've had it for less than 4 months and it loses connectivity in the middle of the night making this awful beeping sound that wakes us up. We live in a NYC apartment, so we are definitely not out of range. I shouldn't be waking up from the sound of my monitor, I should be waking up because of the baby."
"2383","4","I bought this for me to keep and eye on my nephew when he spends the night.  love it"
"2384","3","The cameras work great on the phone application but the device that comes with doesn't work keep flashing and cannot control the camera with the monitor"
"2385","3","its ok, the only CON against the new version is the size and resolution... has better sound and sign"
"2386","1","I've had 3 of these units in the last couple of months. They all came with or quickly developed hardware issues -- all 3 times in different ways. I can only conclude that the manufacturing and quality control process for this product is complete JUNK.We got the first one at a baby shower. It worked great, for about 3 weeks -- then the touch buttons on the right side became unresponsive. We liked the unit, so we returned it (luckily the gift giver was thoughtful enough to include a gift receipt), and bought a replacement unit on Amazon. (It was more cost effective to use our store credit from the gift on something else, and buy the baby monitor here.) The 2nd unit came.... and the camera worked great, but the buttons didn't light up. Pretty useless if you use the monitor in the dark. So we returned that unit to Amazon and got a replacement unit..... and when we opened that one, the AC plug won't even fit into the slot, because the little male joint inside the unit is way out of whack and not centered.3 units, 2 months, all 3 have different problems. Motorola, what the heck are you doing? Don't you have any semblance of manufacturing quality or quality control? It's totally ridiculous. As much as we liked the camera for the 3 weeks we had a working unit, we have to use a different solution -- Motorola's units clearly are just not manufactured in a careful way. The units are junk."
"2387","2","Returned due to issues with their software."
"2388","2","Parent and cameras have many communication issues.  Sounds stops working after parent is turned off."
"2389","5","Perfect choose."
"2390","5","Arrived on time and was exactly as described. It was a gift for my daughter and she loves it! I did buy it again."
"2391","3","This monitor is nice but the night vision is very bad. We had the much cheaper version of Motorola monitor that seamed to work a little better but this does offer the remote pan & tilt plus online viewing."
"2392","5","A great monitor."
"2393","1","As I opened the item it seemed that it has already been used, even though I bought it brand new. The screen has scratches on them and the cable also seemed to be used."
"2394","5","Great camera...  i haved bougth 5 different cameras, honestly this is the best one. Great night view, great sound quality... love the zoom and tilt side ways move."
"2395","5","Great quality images. Awesome if you download the app you can watch while at work or away."
"2396","1","We have owned this monitor for four months and now the sound has stopped working. I went to return it and our return window just recently ended, so we are stuck with an expensive piece of junk. Don't buy it. I'm not a happy customer."
"2397","1","This monitor is HORRIBLE! We bought this during my maternity leave and have been putting up with this for a year now. It constantly looses the signal with the camera and beeps until you do something. Either attempt to power it off (half the time it freezes and does nothing, but still beeps), or go to the camera to unplug it. Then you have to hope the tiny little restart button actually works. All this while the baby is sleeping, when I could be doing anything else!Also, the cell phone app takes forever to load, and doesn't connect to the camera most of the time. About once a month it works.  Do NOT buy this!"
"2398","1","I did not receive the right product and I am facing lot of trouble to send it back from Brazil.I bought the product with 2 cameras and received with only one."
"2399","5","nice product"
"2400","1","Venia en p<U+00E9>simas condiciones"
"2401","1","I wish there were zero stars this is a piece of junk, dying and won<U+2019>t charge after 6 months of use ..,thanks Motorola...don<U+2019>t buy this item."
"2402","1","This camera is so horribly slow that it's not be usable.  Too bad zero stars isn't an option."
"2403","1","The screen stopped working after the second used.It just didn<U+2019>t turn on and didn<U+2019>t charge. Two days after giving up of charging it, it start beeping for two hours.It is a total disappointment!!!"
"2404","2","Video quality below expected, night vision very poor, handheld monitor low quality video, lost signal within few meters. Noise feedback on both monitor and remote application. Only thing good is the remote app on cell phone."
"2405","1","Had for 1 month and already stopped working. Tried troubleshooting but no luck. Product seems to be defective. Also had horrible service when it worked- would lose signal just 1 room over!"
"2406","2","I really wanted something with both wifi and a traditional ""parent unit"" monitor that you can just leave on, but there aren't a lot of those out there (at least there werent a year ago when I was shopping).  Having the portable monitor is way more convenient than using the app (if I had to pick one at this point I'd go with the monitor).The hardware is acceptable but the software on the monitor is a total dumpster fire. If you have it set to automatically turn the screen off it actually freezes the screen instead about 20% of the time and customer support online just tells you not to use that feature! So you think you're seeing a sleeping baby but you're actually looking at a picture from 30 minutes ago. It has a hard time reconnecting if you let the battery die too, you often have to go reset the camera (fun if the baby is sleeping) to get it to reconnect. There are some other issues as well but those are the biggest ""fails at being a monitor"" issues.There must be better options."
"2407","1","Item arrived with a hand written note that said <U+201C>Deffective! Do NOT resell this item!<U+201D>  We received a non functioning item that shouldn<U+2019>t have gone out in the first place."
"2408","5","Great and fast setup"
"2409","5","Bought this system so that I can view the kids rooms on my phone while away.  System works great and gives such peace of mind.  The lullaby feature is a life saver for when my little wakes up in the middle of the night."
"2410","1","This camera drops its signal in the middle of the night when nothing has touched it or changed its position in anyway. The range is not far & the wifi app rarely works."
"2411","1","Extremely low sound, very cheaply made. Not recommended."
"2412","1","I bought this on march 31. I turn it on last week and is doesnt work anymore. Looks like the monitor is not charging anymore.. I just trough my money to the trash with this."
"2413","3","Sometimes is a bit unstable, but generally works correctly. Web application a bit outdated. Generally ok, but nothing spectacular"
"2414","1","I've had this camera since September 2016. Worked great until this week. It won't charge and is completely dead. Don't waste your money on this product if you intend to have it for an extended period of time."
"2415","1","very poor product. the soundit does not work and the night image is blurred and has a black strip on the screen. do not buy"
"2416","2","Camera does not tilt down enough to look in the crib. We have to rig the camera on our window sill to see the baby in the crib"
"2417","5","Awesome picture. Good connection to wifi. Music plays clear and consistent. Voice comes through clear when you speak through the app. Easy to set up and mount. Tells you temp in room, will alert if temp drops. Movement can also send an alert to you as well as sound. Camera tilts up, down, right and left for a great view of the room. Can hear everything in the house from this camera and can hear my son breathing from across his room.I will update if the app has issues or is buggy but reviews of app are good so I don't expect many issues.This is a high quality product. We were tearing our hair out with gynoii's product and this is a 1000x better than that."
"2418","4","It has a little delay using the monitor but in general is great product."
"2419","1","Monitor screen went black and fuzzy. Very hard to hear when I<U+2019>m not in the room. Very poor camera for the price not very satisfied with my purchase."
"2420","5","Perfect. Works really well"
"2421","1","A piece of junk. The touchscreen on our monitor didn't work, the buttons needed the force of an elephant to get any reaction. The camera kept disconnecting and beeping and refused to respond when we tried to move it. The final straw was when the sound cut out. Do not buy this product or the accompanying monitor"
"2422","4","decent range.didn't use the WiFi-mobile feature.If you are thinking about getting a new baby monitor, I would suggest a monitor with a wireless camera."
"2423","1","Piece of junk. 2 months in use and it won't even turn on! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
"2424","1","Its not working very well. The signal gets cut off very often even though it is nearby. Will ask for a replacement for a second shot. We've been using Motorola monitors for years and this is the first time that doesn't work right."
"2425","1","This camera isn't working properly, after try to synchronize the camera with the app, everything looks freeze. The parents monitor never pass the motorola screen, and the app keeps trying to connect the camera.Terrible product"
"2426","4","We bought this because my husband travels a bit for work and we love it. The video quality is phenomenal and all the features like pan tilt zoom are super helpful so you don't have to keep moving the monitor around."
"2427","4","bad sinal"
"2428","2","Not loud enough and freezes all the time."
"2429","1","Battery charger stopped working on the first night we moved our daughter to her crib at three months. The monitor won<U+2019>t hold a charge so it<U+2019>s useless."
"2430","2","I can't even use this item, it came with a European wall plug.  Have to figure out how to get an American plug now. Such a pain."
"2431","1","I bought these products and in less than 2 months has stopped transmitting the sound, the image fails. Bad product. I thought buying from a famous brand I would have more security"
"2432","1","Bad product!!! The cable don't work in the 3rd month  and i lost 50$ because Amazon only refound 167$so is a bad deal for Amazon customers!"
"2433","1","After one year this baby monitor now seems to consistently lose video signal which is Really disappointing given what we paid for it"
"2434","5","Had it for about a month.  Works great no problems.  App with notifications is nice too"
"2435","1","One of the worst monitors we have ever owned.  Sound does not work well.  The internet viewing function does not work very well.  Seems to always be searching for the camera."
"2436","5","We bought this for our Niece and her new baby, and so far she loves it.  She is amazed that it tells the temperature in the babies room, so as far as I am concerned it is a good buy!!"
"2437","1","Camera not working without ac adaptor. Monitor batery after 3 hours finishAt the night time not good screen"
"2438","5","The system is easy to use. It connected to my wifi without trouble and pairing it with my mobile was really easy."
"2439","2","Horrible quality. Lags on live video streaming toy our cell phone. Jumpy video even on the monitor. Will be selling it for cheap if I can't return it."
"2440","1","If I could, I<U+2019>d give this monitor a negative 100! It completely stopped working after 4 months. Extremely disappointed!"
"2441","4","Love this monitor. Just wish the app that works on my phone would stop logging me out."
"2442","2","The audio is very quiet, and the image is pixilated."
"2443","4","Its a great product but it has a very noticeable delay, and it could really annoy you some time"
"2444","5","Perfect gift for a new mom & dad"
"2445","2","The camera quality is good and there's are great options but the battery quality is really low and I always end up charging it twice a day"
"2446","1","This had constant errors in the usage of it.  It would not pair appropriately, difficult to use, would not recommend."
"2447","5","LOVE this monitor. We had a motorola traditional video monitor before we bought this one. The large screen is great. The touchscreen is nice and can be ""locked"" as it is sensitive. The wi-fi is a great feature! We had no problem setting it up and it works well. I especially like to be able to open the app while away and see my sweetheart sleeping! You can even take video or photos through the app. You must setup your home wi-fi with passcode and then also add an app passcode. We've only had it 2 months, but so far so good!"
"2448","5","great gift"
"2449","5","Love it!  I use it as a dog cam to check in on my dogs during the day when I am gone.  The picture has great clarity and the speaker is clear."
"2450","1","The camera and monitor didn't connect so the monitor just kept beeping and no audio or visual. Did not work at all. Returned after only 24 hours."
"2451","1","Will no longer connect with the monitor via wifi or Bluetooth after one year of use."
"2452","5","Great for logging in and checking."
"2453","1","I bought the baby monitor and ask to be delivered to Brazil. It came missing the camera support!!"
"2454","3","i love it but the speakers are too low its hard to hear the kids and the second camera is blurry"
"2455","1","I would like to know what I can do, because it doesn<U+2019>t work anymore. And Motorola says we have 1 year warranty."
"2456","3","Overall it is not a bad system compared to other baby video monitors I have had.  The first set I received had a bad monitor and Motorola wanted me to pay return freight in order to get a replacement even though the unit was bad out of the box, they said it was Motorola's policy so I would say that they are not very customer friendly, fortunately I bought it from Amazon and they had free exchanges so I sent it back to Amazon and they sent me a new one.Pros:Easy to setup - good picture quality including night vision - good range - Wi-Fi connection available but have not set up yetCons:The stand that is on the back of the monitor is poorly designed and lasted about 2 weeks - the volume is not nearly as loud as our previous video monitor - the time will change within a day of setting it (jumps 4 hours ahead every time)"
"2457","5","Baby shower"
"2458","5","One of My Best Purchases yet....the only monitor to buy(!)we have 2 kids and this gadget makes it so easy at night"
"2459","5","best baby monitor you can buy."
"2460","1","<U+00A0>The touch button does not work. I would like to change the item."
"2461","5","The best technology at this moment to protect newborns.  I give it as a gift and the couple love it."
"2462","2","The connection of the USB are loose and don't hold to the monitor. The pretty disappointing."
"2463","2","I'm only giving it two stars for when this monitor actually worked- it was nice. And by that I mean only on wifi on my phone. I was skeptical when I bought this because of all the bad reviews but it really did have everything I was looking for- a frequency monitor so in case our wifi went out in the middle of the night it'd be okay, a wifi option, day and night vision, ability to take photos and a temperature detector. Too good to be true obviously! For $300, this should be the crem de la crem, but it's a piece of crap. My baby is one month old and I've used it only a handful of times but tonight I wanted to have him go straight to his crib for the first time at night... He's sleeping everything is perfect. Go in my bedroom then on the monitor and it beeps (which it constantly did in the past but eventually stopped after 5 mins). It kept beeping and beeping and beeping and there's no mute button for the beeping so my thumb covering the sound and under a blanket under a pillow I walked in to the nursery to get a better connection with the antenna up... NOTHING (but beeping)... Shut off the main camera and turned it back on... NOTHING (but beeping)... Walked back to the bedroom which is right next door... NOTHING (but beeping)! You name it I tried it and now sure enough, he's a-w-a-K-e and I don't know if the inventors of this have children but at this point with my frustration I wanted to do nothing more than to throw this piece of (&/-t) crap out of the damn window!!! Everyone deserves their money back ... I'm so very disappointed after trusting the Motorola brand so many times in the past!!! What should I do now? It's horrible!"
"2464","1","Battery life is terrible. After only 3.5 months the charge runs out within an hour unless plugged in."
"2465","5","Easy set-up and enjoy that the system can be operated remotely with the application."
"2466","1","Horrible. The battery lasts for like 1 hour and the sound/speaker stopped working!"
"2467","3","Parent unit was defective.  Motorola replaced the unit and so far so good, although it powers up rather slowly."
"2468","5","Absolutely love the camera! It does exactly what we wanted. Perfect for families with a spouse that travels."
"2469","1","We weren't able to make it work not even for 1 day, we needed to have both, the camera and the second device in the same room to make it work..."
"2470","5","Great product my daughter loves it for my grandson"
"2471","5","Very usefull, it is working good. You need to have a good wifi to use de app"
"2472","4","Works as advertised, Great range and battery life. iOS app been used way more than expected and works well. The motor feature is delayed more than the previous model."
"2473","1","Plugs stopped charging product after 4 months, so essentially unable to use unless I hold plug in place.  Very disappointed."
"2474","2","Love Motorola but have had one issue after another with this monitor. Between the camera and monitor taking forever to respond to each other to them not recognizing each other. Loved my nonwifi connectivity monitor better."
"2475","1","If you are buying this camera because you want a base unit and an app on you/your spouses's phone for maximum flexibility- then DONT.It is a waste of time, can't keep a signal to wifi, drops connection, has a long lag (30 seconds) when it does connect. $200 is among the pricier versions of baby monitors, and it's useless. The monitor that comes with the camera is sub-par as well. You can't turn the screen off at night, while maintaining sound monitoring. So unless you like sleeping with a glaring LCD screen in your bedroom you are out of luck with this device. Zero stars is my rating.Motorola can't do one thing well with this product, let alone the 7 they advertise.I should have heeded the advice of others. Luckily I was able to return this.Goodbye MOTO!!!"
"2476","1","my order came wrong, I bought it with two cameras and it came with a"
"2477","4","The recharge of the battery is very time consuming. The sound and picture quality is very good."
"2478","5","easy set up!"
"2479","5","Works very well. No complaints."
"2480","5","The baby monitor works great it was able to pair with my old stuff"
"2481","2","Monitor is awful, very pixelated, constantly shaking and flashing. Very glitchy."
"2482","1","After several months, the monitor stopped charging."
"2483","3","it s ok, not really good"
"2484","4","Muy bueno el producto pero llego roto un cargador."
"2485","1","Camera came in a white generic box. No power cord or manual. WTF"
"2486","1","been through two (1 original, 1 warranty replacement) in 10 months. not worth the money or the hastle."
"2487","1","The charge port broke less than 2 months of using the monitor."
"2488","1","The screen stopped working after 10 months ..."
"2489","5","having had other baby monitors I am very pleased with this one - so far, so good!!!"
"2490","3","It has an excellent resolution scream, however the sound is not so good."
"2491","1","Do not recommend. Keeps shuting down without reason and we don<U+2019>t hear the baby."
"2492","1","The long lag time (30 to 60 seconds) on the local WiFi network and constant ""reconnecting"" makes this monitor unacceptable - same as reported in other reviews. BTW - we have very fast internet speeds (50 MBs) and still had these issues."
"2493","5","Works perfectly as advertised and had zero issues setting up or connecting to other devices via wifi. I am an IT professional so I wasn't scared away by other reviews that said it was difficult to connect and as it turns out, it couldn't have been easier or more smooth. My IT knowledge was never needed or used. Great picture and sound. The video shuts off on the monitor after a few minutes or you can turn it off/on at will to save battery life (great feature). So when it's off, it's like a traditional sound only baby monitor, but you can always quickly turn it on to see what's going on. It's very nice having the ability to use cell phones, tablets, etc. in addition to the monitor, especially when you aren't at home."
"2494","3","Cameras are okay.  Clear picture and nice features but there are some cons.1. It does freeze up and my LO was awake in her crib a little longer than usual because the monitor was frozen.2. The notifications I got from day 1 were insane so I had to turn that feature off. Over 200 notifications within a couple of hours3. Accessibility! The wifi capability is mediocre at best and we can only pair one device per camera.  When I'm away for work I want to be able to log into Hubble and see what's going on and so does my husband.  Every time his phone pairs with a camera it disappears from mine and visa versa.We are seriously contemplating returning the cameras because of issue 3.  That was the whole point of getting this set!"
"2495","1","I didn't like this product at all. The sound of the monitor broke with 2 months of use and there isn't assistance in my country."
"2496","1","Crappy quality. The first unit we bought, stopped working 2 days after we bought it. This is our 2nd u it (same brand/model). The monitor's touch screen buttons don't work well. We keep losing the wifi signal on one of our cameras (we have 3)."
"2497","5","Great product works well with all of its functions."
"2498","4","Great product<U+201C>Down tilt<U+201D> feels a bit limited.Also a short delay in video feed."
"2499","1","I've had to purchase this twice. Both times the monitor stopped working."
"2500","4","This works very well! I would like it to have a longer range than it does, but overall, great product!"
"2501","5","Very good product and easy usimg . Thanks!"
"2502","1","Camera screen kept going out.  Had to replace."
"2503","5","Had no issues with it so far, connects every time and video quality seems ok"
"2504","5","Muito boa"
"2505","1","Stopped working two days after I got it"
"2506","1","Broke right after 90 days of having it. Buttons went out after the first month. Very overpriced and now stuck with it since it's been past 90 days. Very unhappy with this purchase."
"2507","1","THE MOTORILA MBP854 CRASHES AND THE SOUND IS VERY LOW"
"2508","1","It's not working well no signal at all"
"2509","5","Excellent featuresPeace of mind"
"2510","1","The screen is not really HD, and the remote control has some delay, not smooth.Finally, it's so expensive."
"2511","5","We liked it, very easy t<U+00F4> use, And it's possible t<U+00F4> connect via hubble for IOS"
"2512","5","awesome product, I recommend!"
"2513","4","The camera works well, but the monitor is awful. I downloaded the app to watch my baby while I'm at work and she's at home with the nanny. Unfortunately the server goes down quite often or the app is updating so there are many times I cannot connect. This is very frustrating. That being said, this camera does take pretty good pictures and is easy to maneuver."
"2514","5","People are so hard on this product, but I think it's great.  I also bought an extra camera."
"2515","5","It is a excelent baby monitor."
"2516","1","Worst monitor I've ever used. The resolution is so poor at night that I can't even see my baby in the crib."
"2517","5","Good camera but better long for less"
"2518","5","I really liked this product"
"2519","1","Picture quality is poor and you consistently have to pair your phone to the camera."
"2520","1","The charger doesn't stay in the unit. It's too loose. And the screen keeps freezing up"
"2521","5","An excellent product."
"2522","1","Do not buy this product! We are on our fifth set of these because all we can get is a replacement at this point. The customer care team is very nice and always replaces the product with no issue, which could be an indication of how crappy the product is. Problems we have had include: sound not working, not keeping time, lag in monitor, screen flashing random colors and grainy picture, and not keeping charge for more than a couple of hours. We started out with the summer infant monitor but thought the picture quality of the Motorola would allow us to better keep an eye on the baby. Boy were we wrong! Should've stuck with summer!"
"2523","1","Quit working after 4 months! The camera won't move."
"2524","5","Just what we needed. It does the job and is simple to use."
"2525","4","Excellent product works great"
"2526","3","Works...."
"2527","1","After 7/8 months our camera stopped working. The video monitor does not turn on anymore - just a blank screen with loud beeping sounds. We can log in using the app, but most of the time is just says ""loading"" and we never actually see the feed. The 4 second delay is more annoying than I thought it would be. The app didn't seem to work well, we always had difficulty connecting. At first the notifications from the app were nice, but even with the sensitivity turned all the way down, we would still get notifications throughout the day while no-one was home - which is pretty freaky until you get used to it. We live in an apartment, so the sound was probably from neighbors, or picking up movement outside from cats or birds, but it will still annoying. Eventually we stopped using notifications because they were just excessive. The backlight on the monitor was okay in our bedroom at night, it was a little bright but not terribly bad. what I didn't like was the white indicator light - it was so bright that I had to keep the monitor face down otherwise it was blinding. We never used the feature where you could speak into the monitor, or the music. The music didn't seem soothing and would just keep the little one awake. Overall, this was a disappointing purchase, and I wish we would have bought another model or brand. As of today, we've had it less than a year and do not use it at all because of all the connectivity issues. It's not helpful to us if it's not reliable. And it broke just after the period we could have returned it by, so we really just wasted our money."
"2528","2","Poor quality"
"2529","5","Fast and great quality!!"
"2530","1","Update: After 4 days of use, I am taking back the star that I gave it for the in-house monitor. Wish I could give it zero. I am taking the whole system down and going back to my 2 year old Angelcare monitor. Motorola is lucky to be receiving it back in one piece.I am normally not such a harsh critic, but the details below will justify my criticism here.The sound quality is pretty poor. I do use white noise in my son's room, and I think the sound filtering that this does makes the monitor ineffective when used in a room with a white noise machine. With the volume at max on the handheld, I could barely hear my son's voice when he woke, and I could not hear my husband's voice at all when he was talking to him in the room. With my Angelcare, I can hear the slightest sound at half volume, even with the white noise coming through over the monitor.The sound and video come through at about a full second delay. My Angelcare has no discernable delay. Not a huge deal, but slightly annoying knowing that it is possible to not have it.The picture quality is quite a bit better than my Angelcare, but the frame rate is about half of what my Angelcare gives. I suppose that would be a logical trade off for sending more data, but I am perfectly fine with smoother video at half the resolution. What I need to see, I can see on the Angelcare. I think this one is a wash and comes down to personal preference. Knowing that I can get smooth video at 1080p over the internet, I do believe it should be possible to get smooth video over a 2.4GHz local private connection when transmitted 25 feet or less... Just sayin'.The pan function is nice to have. The Angelcare is static, but that suits us just fine until we transition from the crib. However, the pan function is very clumsily implemented. I hold a pan button for about 3-4 seconds, and then the video frame begins to move. I have to release the pan button BEFORE the camera is where I want it to stop, probably because of the video delay. Fine movements are just not possible with this camera. This results in fighting with the camera overshooting the target, back and forth, over and over, until it lands where you mean to aim it. Incredibly frustrating.When the camera was disconnected from power after my initial setup to mount it on the wall, the camera went from ""connected"" status in the hubble app to ""offline"" and never recovered. I saw somewhere that Motorola support claims that the camera wifi connection should recover itself after power loss. This was not the case in my experience. It never reconnected itself to my wifi network. I think I am at square one and need to delete the camera and fight the process to add the camera again, and I just don't have time or energy for that frustration again.And the final straw - My 2-year old son has been going through a sleep regression, and had been waking earlier and earlier each day this last week. Having to wake and soothe him at 2am is difficult after having had perfect sleep for months. Long story short - 2 days ago, we had a successful night and he did not wake us up. That was the night the fricking monitor woke me up like a beeping alarm clock because the handheld unit lost its connection with the camera. There is no discernible reason for the connection to drop. There was still power to the camera, there was no movement in the house, and the camera and handheld were literally a room and a hallway apart from each other with full signal. I powered off the handheld before it woke my husband up, and powered it back on. Camera still on, signal still full strength. This happened twice that night. The first time I was angry. The second time, I almost threw it at the wall. My Angelcare has NEVER done that in 2 years of use. The only time the Angelcare ever lost signal was when the camera lost power or when I set the monitor right next to the refrigerator.This monitor is a complete failure as a wifi monitor, and a dismal implementation of an in-home monitor.----------------------------------------------------Original Review: I am pretty tech savvy but setup was NOT easy for me. I had an easier time getting my entire home network playing together nicely (a Windows server domain, 3 computers, 3 tablets, a network printer, 3 Cisco ip phones, a linux SQL server, 2 chromecasts, a Wii and an Amazon FireTV all connecting through an ipcop firewall and a dual-radio wifi access point) than I had setting up this camera.I did, however, get it to connect to my wifi finally.The first thing that I had success with was connecting directly from my iphone to the camera via the camera's wifi, and updating the firmware.After that, the process of getting it connected to my home wifi took about an hour of trial-and-error.The key to getting this to connect was noticing that when prompted to enter the wifi password, WPA security was preselected and the app wouldn't let me change that.Most wifi networks nowadays default to WPA2 which is not the same thing. Since I couldn't select WPA2 in the hubble app setup, I had to create a secondary VLAN wifi connection that uses WPA for the camera to connect to. Not all wifi routers/access points will offer this option.If that is the case for you, you will need to reconfigure your home network and all attached devices to use WPA instead of WPA2, which might trickle into compatibility issues with your other devices.Of course, Hubble/Motorola could remedy this by allowing us to select WPA2 during setup.That said...After figuring out that I needed to use WPA, restarting setup seemed to be hit-and-miss. I got many repeats of the ""setup failed"" message and prompts to retry, camera not detected messages, etc. It seemed to be associated with the pairing process having been started at a point other than when the app prompts to press the pair button. I struggled because the red pairing light would continue blinking for some time after the camera announced setup had failed. I tried powering off and on, but upon power on, the red light would still be blinking.Yet sometimes, when the blue light is blinking (no red), when I press the pair button for 3 seconds it only beeps and does not say ""ready for pairing"" or give the red led. It may eventually startle you after several minutes has passed by finally going into pairing mode.Or when attempting the wifi-based setup, when the camera says ""ready for pairing"", the camera does not show up  in the wifi list on my iphone for a couple minutes. It appears to be very temperamental.With persistence, I finally got confirmation that the camera had been connected successfully.The next thing I did was to come here to share my discovery with other Amazon users. I tapped the camera in my Hubble iphone app but got a message about low bandwidth. I ignored that for the moment and began typing this review.As I was typing, the camera gave the announcement that setup has failed. I am not sure why. The camera is still listed in my iphone app and on the hubble website, but its status is Offline. I have not yet been able to get the video feed to either the iphone or web browser. The handheld screen is displaying the video feed though, so I know the camera is on.I turned the camera off and on, and the camera is still offline to the apps.It would be nice if there was a way to view the MAC address of the camera's wifi connection so that I could verify that it is connected to my network.Anyways, despite the confirmation that the camera successfully connected, and the existence of it in the camera list on the web site, there is no video feed.I see on my wifi access point connection list that there is nothing connected now to the WPA connection I created for the camera. I turn the camera off and on, still no change.I try to add the camera again through the hubble app, with no success. Now the camera is not listed at all in the hubble app or on the web site. I am back at the beginning now, and another hour has passed.The thing that is driving me nuts is the fact that I have gotten different results after repeating the same process so many times.I am saying a prayer that I get this connected before I go into labor.I found a few more clues while trying again several times. According to my access point, the camera connects briefly and then disappears from the connection list. It shows a Tx and Rx rate of 1KB. The access point is just outside my office door and up a floor on the wall in the hallway. My iphone shows full signal, but I consider the possibility that the wifi hardware in the camera is just not as powerful. (At least now I have the camera's MAC address)I took the camera upstairs and ran through the process again. Now the access point is about the same distance away but on the same floor. The setup succeeded and the camera shows online in the app. I cannot get the hubble web site to load my list of cameras though.I also note that before this success, I had my Angelcare video monitor on (which I love, but want to upgrade to a wifi camera) and I believe that camera also transmits at 2.4GHz. It may be possible that was causing some interference, but the fact that it didn't affect the handheld unit and the fact that I get a strong wifi signal on ALL my other devices even when that was on makes me hesitant to blame the angelcare fully. Plus, the Angelcare and monitor were both upstairs while I was failing miserably downstairs.Anyways, back to the video feed...I click on the camera (online) in my hubble app. I get the spinning flower petals, then it says ""Low data bandwidth detected. Trying to connect..."".Then it says ""Camera is not accessible""Then I tap on the back button, and a little message flashes for about a second that says ""Request failed: service unavailable (503)""Huh. This indicates to me that the hubble website is overloaded. It also makes sense now that the app.hubbleconnected.com website will not load my dashboard after I log in.I quit the app on my phone and log in a few times. Every couple of log ins, I get this 503 service unavailable error. Trying to update settings from my phone on the camera requires several tries to get it to ""stick"". It is apparent that the communication through the internet service is (at least currently) unreliable.I give the monitor 2 stars though because although the primary feature that sets this model apart from lower (non-wifi) models is desperately lacking, it appears to be a decent in-home monitor. The handheld unit it came with worked right out of the box. But there is a less expensive option available to get the same level of functionality.I may be returning this if over the next few days I don't see a drastic improvement in service uptime.-------------TL;DR: - Wifi setup will only work with WPA security, not WPA2. (Update: but don't bother) - If at first you don't succeed, try try again. Eventually it will connect. It may take a few hours though. You have to hold your mouth just right, and flap your arms like a superstitious pigeon. That worked for me. (Update: You can get it to connect, but it isn't worth the effort) - It appears that the distance to the wifi router matters, and it is possible that other 2.4GHz devices may interfere with this. Be aware of these things. - The web service seems to be overloaded and intermittently available at best. After finally setting up successfully, I still have no video feed online. Sound detection notification works. - The in-home monitor works right out of the box. (Update: but it sucks royally) - The sound quality of the in-home monitor is poor, the pan function is clunky and frustrating, the video/sound have a major delay, the signal drops for no good reason (waking you in the middle of the night).I do not recommend this if you are buying it for the remote viewing capability.Update: Strike that. I do not recommend this monitor AT ALL.I am still looking for a good monitor for viewing over the internet on my iphone. If anybody has a recommendation, I sure would appreciate it. Until then, my trusty Angelcare is working perfectly for at-home use, even after being dropped probably 20 times over the last couple years of use.If you are interested, here is the Angelcare that I have been using and love:<U+00A0>Angelcare Video, Movement and Sound Monitor, Gray/white"

"2544","4","MBP853 Connect w/ 1 camera. Have not tried others.First time parent, so we looked at a lot of models before choosing this one.Easy set up, firmware upgrade must be done near wifi router as it was not getting it done from 30 feet away. From the app it did it nicely.App is great, everything works as advetised, sound lag is less than 1 sec. Used it simultaneously from 4 iOS devices (love the iPad app) and all good. Recording works perfectly and sound or movement notifications work even on Apple Watch.Only flaws I found were that the image colors were not so realistic and that it goes to black and white a lot, kind of cheap since its an expensive system but I dont care much about color since its mostly going to be used during the night. When kts bright its ok colors but goes to gray a lot.The handheld monitor is pretty straightforward, it comes paired with the included camera so not hard to use out of the box. Looks easy to manage, has an antenna for added reception. Auto off is good at 5 mins, 30 or 60. Has lights to indicate sound changes. Also has a foldable leg to keep it standing. Battery life is not bad. It's pretty sturdy but I would not drop it.So basic system with wifi and remote capabilities. Expndable, looks durable and would recommend.Hope they fix color in a future firmware update.Thanks motorola for a fine product. Will update this post if something goes wrong."

"2548","5","great product, work with 220v"
"2549","5","It is what I expected, great product"
"2550","1","The App does not connect as easily as we hoped. The camera does not respond very quickly, making adjustments difficult. Overall for the price I would recommend finding another model."
"2551","1","Worked OKAY for 3-4 months, then after series of app upgrades we can no longer see the feed remotely. Happened around iOS 10 release so suspect motorola messed up something there. Even when works, does not deserve 5 stars:- as others mentioned, camera moves in large increments, hard to position precisely  remotely.- no position memory : once you moved the camera, you are on your own to return to initial position- night vision mode leaves much to be desired.UPDATE: up 1 star, someone from Motorola support contacted me the day after I posted and suggested firmware update - which largely resolved the issue - I can now connect about 90% of the time.Still have some reliability issues and security concerns - but definite credit for nice service recovery!ANOTHER update: Sound on parent unit stopped working tonight, we did not know the baby was crying until it was so loud we heard it without the monitor."
"2552","5","Perfect"
"2553","4","night vision not that great"
"2554","1","We have only been using this for 3 months and the cord doesn't always connect to charge and the video goes in and out.  It also does not hold charge well and has a bulky thing near where you plug it into the monitor which gets in the way when you pick it up to view.  Last night the sound did not register even though it was on.  I heard the baby throught the house and ran to the room to find him very upset.  He has obviously been crying for awhile.  We have a similar motorola from a few years earlier and it still works fine.  This one does not and now it is too late to return.  Not inexpensive either.  Maybe its the wifi?"
"2555","1","The newer version of this unit is horrible.  The old unit was perfect, never cut out/lost signal.  My old screen (2 yrs old) broke so had to buy a new unit because Motorola does not sell a replacement screen.  They offered to do a out of warrant repair/replacement but didn't provide a price (customer service was horrible, took them 4 days to respond to my email).  The new unit cuts out periodically (you get that annoying beeping in the middle of the night) and there is a major lag time with the up/down and side/side control.  It will be returned to Amazon.  Maybe will try one more unit before moving to another brand or just run the old camera with the Hubble App and use my smartphone/tablet as the monitor."
"2556","4","Very happy with this monitor. Some problems with internet connection but probably caused by my service provider."
"2557","1","Camera and parent unit are great. The ""Hubble Connected"" server for viewing outside of ones home on your phone NEVER works. They are always experiencing major outages. It has been experiencing major outages in service ever since I purchased this product...what an extra waste of money for the ""internet"" feature...it never works!!"
"2558","5","Excellent baby monitor"

"2562","5","Tilt, pan, two way communication, love it!"
"2563","3","Pros- Great app for your smartphone that works well in home or on the go- Camera delivers clear images, useful information and setup easilyCons- It uses micro USB... Yay... BUT with a very specific power requirement. Using your phone micro USB leads to malfunction.- The buttons on it are sensitive and horribly placed. It's hard to pick up without inadvertently moving the camera view away from your baby.If you are looking for a mobile phone capable monitor and can deal with a few glitches, this is for you."
"2564","5","Excellent Product"
"2565","5","Excelent"
"2566","2","DO NOT buy this baby monitor. My husband was insistent on a wifi monitor, but I wanted a parent unit. A monitor with both of these features is hard to come by, so despite the reviews we chose this. It worked ok at first, and the picture is good. The app downloaded fine but my husband had some issues with it working and ended up never using it anyway. Everytime our internet or power goes out, no way to see the baby. After a couple of months the parent unit stopped being able to toggle the camera down. Then the camera just stopped connecting entirely. Now it's just an expensive paperweight and I have no way to see my baby that has medical needs."

"2572","3","ive read so many reviews on this and after buying one for myself i dont think one of these reviews is valid.connecting was a breeze, no issues if you actually read the instructions.1stly the hubble app performs great. sound and picture quality is clear. all controls are easy and simple except the pan is a little rough, its not instantaneous, its not a big deal.the sound from the parent unit is what stinks. the picture and features are all good enough i cant complain. but the sound is just not loud enough, at night the babys cries can barely be heard. and whats funny is on the hubble app its super loud.after everything ive come to the realization that is really better to have 2 separate cameras in each of our babies rooms for the same price as this unit. buy 2 foscams for 50$ each and buy the samsung w 2 cameras. so far no company has been able to perfect the ability to do both.if your not soo worried about the volume from the parent unit then this is a great option, hopefully motorola can put a better quality speaker in the parent unit and then the problem would solved."
"2573","5","Great!"
"2574","5","The best product of its kind"
"2575","5","not sure why there are many negative reviews. may be they wrote the reviews when it had crappy iphone app. it worked perfect for me and i love the camera a lot. here are some pros and cons according to me.pros:- i tried to test the microphone by coughing about 25 feet 3 rooms away. i could clearly hear myself. great that i can peacefully watch a movie when my baby is sleeping and be sure i can hear her wake up.- looks great. i could see how a big name company can make great quality products.- very easy setup using iphone app- app is working great. has all options that i needed (notifications for sound and motion, background running to listen to baby waking up etc.)- small in size, hidden infrared rings- the notifications are displayed in order. great feature. like a security system.- supports WPA2 security. i have 2.4 ghz and 5ghz router. it showed all the 2.4 ghz bands. was successful connecting to older wep and newer wpa2 wifi securitycons:- there is a lag of about 1 second from the camera. compared to foscam where is lag is less than quarter second. i am okay with the lag of about a second.- iphone app forgets the password. the bug was fixed in a weeks time- camera pan and tilt is not smooth. works for me since i hardly change the viewing angle. it will be difficult for someone who regularly tries to logon and do pan/tilt. but since it is software issue hope it gets better- clarity of the camera is 720p. i notice it is less clarity compared to 1080p foscam. does not matter to me since i use it for baby monitoring and not theft kind of situations where higher clarity may be need.- i don't remember seeing the option to set the clarity. it is just 1 hour since i setup the camera. may be i did not check the settings completely. also software issue and i hope it is addressed soon"
"2576","1","often get a disconnected signal. often saying that the baby unit/camera is off, when it is not. other signal just saying ""disconnected"" when both items are on. Motorola quickly sent us a replacement - we will see how it is.Update - After 1 year of using this replacement one, the replacement is now broken as well! Motorola was very responsive last time so hopefully we will experience the same service.The picture is clear, but connection is often lost due to interference from MANY common household appliances.  It seems to me that connectivity should be the #1 priority of a baby monitor."
"2577","1","sond level is very bad or does not work."
"2578","1","The sound on the unit is awful. Even turned all the way up I had a hard time hearing her. The camera would constantly cut out. I was never able to pair the camera with the suggested app so that I could use my phone to view the cameras feed. The battery died very quickly. And then after four days the sound just stopped working all together. Not awesome. Will be returning."
"2579","5","Love the option of a monitor for the house for me and the app for my husband. This is as high tech as baby monitors can get. Wish the price was more affordable. Easy installation and great number of options/features."
"2580","5","great little camera....works well...ended up adding more."

"2585","5","Great"
"2586","4","We love this monitor. It fits our needs and love being able check in on sleeping babies after leaving the house. I would say the Hubble app itself needs some work. As for the camera going off line which I saw was a common problem, the first couple days it was constantly going off line. Loudly waking us up in the middle of the night but after the first couple days it hasn't gone off line once. So I would tell future buyers to give it a couple days to work out its own kinks. It takes a couple days to get use to the hand held monitor as well. But in the end we are happy with the product and will be keeping it."
"2587","5","Obviously helpful around the house, excellent picture with full light, decent in low light, still adequate with the night vision.  The BEST part is my husband who often works in Hawaii has been able to use the app to look around the room to see him, he can talk to the baby and we even held a conversation like a walkie-talkie! Awesome technology!"
"2588","2","For how expensive this monitor is, you'd at least expect it to work. The volume consistently shuts off, and the screen regularly freezes without warning, so you think your baby is still asleep and then if it finally unfreezes you find he's moving around and making noise, but how could you know with no volume? It's terrible. We're calling the manufacturer on this one and hoping they'll reconcile. With another baby only weeks away, we were hoping this high tech monitor with two cameras would help us watch both boys at once, but it doesn't look like this one will help us do anything at all."
"2589","1","Digital display ok at night. We have used this nightly for almost 4 months, and now the base unit does not connect to the handheld unit anymore. No picture, no sound, no temperature reading. Just sounds like white noise, but it doesn't pick up anything meaningful. What a waste of money."
"2590","4","The reason why we bought it was because Amazon was really good at customer service and getting refund/replacement without a hassle. We bought this as a gift. So when the couple we bought it for kept saying they had some sound problem, we got it replaced right away. The second time, they had sound problem again, and Amazon was a trooper at replacing it. After the third try, the couple seem very happy with it. In fact, they said they love it! If we ever have a child, I'd most likely buy this for us too."
"2591","4","I felt compelled to review this after seeing so many negative reviews! I have been using this monitor for the last 8 1/2 months, and although I can only compare it to one other we tried before this, I feel like it's a great monitor. There aren't many on the market that have pan/tilt/zoom, with a nice monitor included, and that has wifi viewing also. The app on the phone and tablet works great. The monitor doesn't have the best battery life, but honestly I keep it on the charger in the living room majority of the time anyway. Overnight I have my tablet plugged in and just use the app.I saw that other reviewers mentioned the picture quality, which I agree isn't the best. When the lights are on, the picture is amazing, but for night vision it's not as clear, understandably so. Other reviewers also mentioned that the sound was loud enough, but I honestly keep it less than halfway and can hear it just fine. The camera movement is also a great feature!!! And the 2-way audio is pretty coolAll in all, we haven't had any issues. It's not perfect, but for all the features it has, I think it's the best that we were able to find. Not sure if they are new models out since we bought ours, but I have no regrets about this monitor thus far!"
"2592","5","Registered for this at Buy Buy Baby and didn't get it. Only to find it for $60 cheaper here. Camera works very well and the app on my phone is a nice bonus also having the temperature is a nice plus as well. Highly recommend this for the price."
"2593","1","We bought for to watch our grandaughter from a room about 50 ft away.  Clear video and audio.  But the darn thing stops working intermittently! How scary !  Quits even fully charged and plugged it.  Hiw irresponsible for a major manufacturer .  Do not buy this potential baby killer ..,"
"2594","5","Love these cameras and that I can check in on the kids' rooms while I'm working nights.Very nice features and easy to use."
"2595","3","It was easy to setup, and works well. however the picture Quality is really not sure under what conditions it would display 720... its not bad where i have it mounted, and i have not decided if i will keep it or not as it was really easy to setup..."
"2596","5","No problems connecting to my wi-fi. The signal will go out 3 times per day, but only for a few seconds. I've had the device for 6 weeks and I've only had to unplug/reset the main device 2 times which is very good in my estimation. The software is good. The text descriptions of activity are accurate and the pop up notifications on your phone are useful. I expect to have wi-fi issues and the software to suck on any baby camera; pleasantly surprised with this item. Highly recommend."
"2597","1","Monitor crapped out after 2 months of use"
"2598","5","This was a gift to my daughter and she absolutely loves it!  She can be outside tending her garden and still see the baby sleeping or crying which she can hear!  Great picture comes thru and she can move the eye for where ever she places the baby and watch from another area!  Awesome gift that is used many hours a day!"
"2599","5","I absolutely love this monitor. I was hesitant to purchase it based on the previous reviews, but I only have great things to say. I love that I can watch him from work on the app, and that my nanny can watch him on the monitor when she's at our home. The quality is great and I love that I can review the photos taken during the day. The texts alerts are also very helpful when I'm sleeping or doing other things around the house. It is worth the money."
"2600","5","The camera works very well - both with the remote monitor and via internet.  There is some small delay when you move the camera, however i consider this normal and acceptable.  The quality of the picture is very good.  Night vision is very nice as well.  Probably you can have a much better quality, functionalities and so on, if you make some DIY system, but for the purposes of baby monitoring this is an excellent product with all functionalities you need."
"2601","1","A very expensive disappointmentI bought two of these and they both had identical problems!!! Do not waste money on this!!!I bought this thinking that this would be a good product as Motorola usually has very good stuff especially when it comes to radios. Well I was totally wrong. It does have very good night vision but the user interface is not user friendly at all. Equipment for babies should be user friendly, this unit is not. There is a rather long delay in the pan/tilt feature. And it takes a long time for the parent unit to link up with the camera.But undoubtedly the most disappointing drawback was how susceptible this thing is to radio frequency interference. Especially since this thing is from Motorola. If u live in an apartment or a townhouse forget it.  Way too much wi-fi interference from other homes. This might work better in a single family house.I bought the first one here from Amazon and the parent unit just would not link up to the camera no matter what I did. For those old enough to remember messing around with rabbit-ears on TV sets, it was kinda like that. The minute I took my hands off the camera, the signal would be lost. Bummer!So I sent it back to Amazon thinking it was a bad unit. I then went to the biggest baby store in the country (you can probably guess which one) and bought the same model there.  Brought it home and sure enough THE EXACT SAME FLAW!!! Went back the the baby store and promptly got my money back.So there you have it. I bought two of the same model units from two different retailers and both failed.This thing is $300! At that price point you'd think it would work flawlessly.  Nope. I bought a unit on Amazon that was half the price of this one, set it up, and the first time I turned it on it worked like a charm. Very user friendly, minimal pan/tilt lag time, great night vision and absolutely zero radio frequency interference!Bottom line, you will not get what you paid for with this expensive unit."
"2602","4","The wifi connection configuration is lost every time you disconnect it... it's not that comfortable to be ""installing"" it again and again and again although it's not difficult"
"2603","2","I wish I had trusted some of the reviews before we purchased... while the camera itself and viewing screen work as expected, the volume is HORRIBLE. Literally, even when holding the monitor up to your ear with the volume turned up all the way it is almost next to impossible to hear any noises/when the baby is stirring. Have played around with it several times, and there seems to be no way to increase the output sound.Wish there was some way we could fix this as we like the other features... but not being able to hear the baby defeats the purpose of having a monitor as I can't be staring at the screen all the time."
"2604","1","I am editing my review after 3 months of using the product.Original review: The monitor really is one of the best on the market - and I love the wifi viewing option for the phone.For some background - I did a lot of research and narrowed down our options to this and the Summer. I still think we made the right decision, but I would like to see these three quirks taken care of.Camera issue: 1) Other commenters have said it - that flashing blue light!!! OMG I caught my son staring at it (instead of sleeping) and I didn't understand what he was looking at until I went in to investigate. IT IS SO BRIGHT! Like any Alaskan, I tried to solve this problem by putting a piece of duct tape over it. One piece alone will dim it considerably. Two pieces is better. I am sure I read about this before buying it and thought, nbd. And it isn't a big deal, really. I just wish I had remembered before putting it in the nursery with my newborn.Parent monitor issue: 2) The monitor beeps when you push one of the side buttons with the volume turned on. I think these two volumes should be independent. I want to be able to put my son down in his dark room, then go outside and check to see if his eyes were closed. (Because, really, who can tell in the dark??) But, if I have the volume on, those buttons beep super loudly right outside his door. So I have to remember BEFORE going to put him down in the first place to turn the volume off on the handheld. And with all that goes into putting a newborn to sleep - I really shouldn't have to be concerned about this.Parent monitor issue: 3) Last thing! Again, this is minor and stupid but it irritates me. I really don't like that if I press the monitor button to check on my son that I then have to press the OK button to unlock the keypad so I can turn the screen off. Steps involved: 3. So, no big deal. But, if you see the way the monitor is set up, it can be a little annoying. And then I'm doing three button pushes (ok, usually 4 or 5 since I'm forgetful so I try to skip step 2) and this goes back to my above complaint. That is 4 or 5 (or, if you are a pro - 3) loud beeps!I gave this 4 stars because I have done the research and I know it is the best monitor out there. But, really Motorola, is this the best YOU can do??Edits:This monitor is an expensive piece of junk. I have to restart either the handheld monitor or the camera almost daily, sometimes several times a day. The camera will all of the sudden stop working in the middle of the night - which makes the handheld monitor start beeping that no camera is attached. I'm telling you, it takes all I have in me not to smash it when it wakes me out of my very precious slumber.Another bad quality - since the buttons on the monitor are touch sensors instead of actual buttons, it is really glitchy. It will stop reading your fingerprint and then you have to reset the handheld to get it to work properly.Lastly and leastly, the monitor will randomly turn itself on and will not go back to sleep on its own. This drains the battery in the day and is really annoying at night when you are trying to sleep.DO NOT BUY THIS MONITOR. Motorola, if you are reading this and you care about your customers, I would appreciate someone contacting me to resolve this debacle. Having a newborn and a faulty monitor do not mix well."
"2605","4","The volume doesn't go loud enough for me to get very far but it's battery powers so i just have to move it around with me more."
"2606","1","Ordered this product for a trip I had with my family and actually had never fully used until a couple of weeks ago and this is a terrible product. The night is so bad I can't even see my daughter. Two cameras and both of them are no good!"
"2607","1","Do not purchase this product if your child sleeps in complete darkness. My husband and I diligently worked the camera around the room in hopes of getting our needs met. We were finally able to get a silhouette of our child when we moved the camera within one foot above her crib. This was not acceptable to us. Considering this feature to be the most important purpose of a monitor I am giving the product one star."
"2608","5","Needed this for our grandson, it is the best one I could find with reasonable screen size"
"2609","1","Always lags when moving camera, terrible sound, image isn't very clear, and takes forever to switch on and off. Other models aren't this way, wish I stuck to the regular and stayed always from the wifi feature."
"2610","4","Only one thing that bothers me about this monitor... the volume is very low... I need silence to hear my baby..."
"2611","5","We have this in my house for my grandchildren and it works great! Allows us to get together in the backyard without any worries!"
"2612","1","Worked well at first, but then it has many failures.. camera gets disconnected from monitor, from wifi, then it starts making noises and interference sounds... really really sucks"
"2613","1","The monitor works well; however, the main issue is hooking the camera up to the phone.  The phone gets disconnected to the camera easily, and the footage freezes and when it does work it appears slowly."
"2614","5","Great quality. I love how you can control the camera through the monitor itself."
"2615","1","I've had nothing but problems with this monitor. It's now been placed 4 times by motorola and each replacement breaks or doesn't work like the first one! awful product. I can't return to motorola so not sure what I'm supposed to do now that it's been replaced by them."
"2616","4","So far so good, way better then the dlink i tried out."
"2617","3","I'm really disappointed that this doesn't have VOX. Even if there's a loud noise or baby wakes, the screen doesn't kick back on unless you tell it to. The volume has to stay on the entire time. Hence the lack of voice activation."
"2618","5","Superb product and light speed delivery!"
"2619","1","I purchased this item because I wanted a baby monitor that (a) was Wifi Enabled (b) had it's own monitor display in addition to an app and (c) could support multiple cameras.  At first it worked pretty well.  The monitor itself does not seem to be HD as some other reviewers have mentioned, though the phone app seems to have better video quality.  The previous version of the app ran well on my Samsung Galaxy S4, I never experienced any crashes or glitches with it, but they recently updated the app and I've experienced several crashes, though they have seemed to become less frequent lately, so I'll chalk this up to typical bugs with a new software release.  Overall, network set up was very straightforward.Now to the really annoying stuff which is the cause for my 1 Star rating.One of the cameras will continually lose connection to the base monitor, when this happens the monitor beeps VERY loudly.  This typically happens in the middle of night waking my wife and I up.  Sometimes it corrects and reconnects on its own, but usually the only fix is to power cycle the camera which means we have to wait until morning so that camera becomes useless for that night.  One time the camera itself actually started beeping, which work our toddler up in the middle of the night freaked out.The other camera we have has never had a connection issue, though it started having image sensor/illumination issues, see attached image.I have a few weeks before the return period expires, so will try to work with Motorola support before I'm forced to return the units."
"2620","4","The cord is failing can I buy an new one?"
"2621","2","I was so disappointed by the image quality of the monitor. After spending $300+ dollars on the monitor I thought it'd be AT LEAST 720p quality (seeing as how it says ""HD"" on the side of the camera). However, it is very poor and narrow. It would be nearly unusable if the camera didn't pan/tilt. I will be returning this and try to find something else for the money. Our old Moto just died so I was trying to replace it with the newer model but the picture quality is just too bad. Please see the attached photos to compare this unit with my Samsung Smartcam. Both pictures were taken within seconds from each other and in the same lighting. You can see that the Samsung show MUCH more of the room, hasn't yet turned on the night vision, and is clearer."
"2622","1","disconnects frequently"
"2623","5","Great monitor!"
"2624","5","Excellent"
"2625","1","The imagine is extremely poor  and not as advertised. I would like to return the product but Amazon won't take it back and now looking into contacting Motorola."
"2626","1","this camera goes offline very often.  have to reconnect it almost everyday.  not recommend this camera."
"2627","1","I sincerely wanted to believe that the poor reviews were just someone's bad luck. However, this product is literally junk. I was buying the newer model to replace my mbp36s which has an issue where the charger doesn't connect with the parent unit well. (Side note: this was my second one of that model with the same issue) I was excited that I would be able to use my phone with the camera. Well I opened the package and charged the parent unit and when I tried to turn it on I got a white screen with the word Motorola on it. Reset it and it did the same thing 4 more times. I left it on that screen and unplugged it and let it die. Next day charged again and turned on. This time it came on, got everything connected and put baby to bed. Camera won't turn. Had to wake up baby to put old monitor back in her room. I'm done. Returning for a refund. I'll find a different brand I suppose. Sooooo disappointed. When I pay almost $300 for something it should work.  I literally would never recommend this monitor to anyone!"
"2628","5","Works very well remotely"
"2629","4","I like this product.  I just wish the monitor was bigger.  But picture is good and it has a lot of useful feature and I definitely like the zoom feature."
"2630","1","I justs bought this camera and the image thru the monitor and the internet app it is blury. Is not HD. It may be a problem with the product I bought."
"2631","2","The sound on this monitor continually came in and out. Also, within 6 months, the battery stopped charging when plugged in. We were extremely disappointed in the overall quality and reliability of the dual camera monitor."
"2632","1","Touch screen is like 1990 style... very basic... the cam doesnt respond as smooth... the older model is much better."
"2633","1","I bought this digital video baby in Nov/2015 and I started using in January 2016, but now she's practically without sound volume."
"2634","3","very good product"
"2635","1","Before the baby was born, we were very happy with the product,  we installed it on the bedroom walls, we covered the cables, we painted on top of the covers, etc...Once the baby was born:1- The battery only lasts for 4 hours,  therefore if it not connected to the mains,  your baby can cry as loud as he wants that you will not listen him.2- The battery takes 12-16 hours to charge,  so it needs to be connected during the whole day to the mains.3-  When one of the cameras looses a strong wifi connectivity (it occurs several times during every night),  it triggers an alarm on the device,  that obviously wakes you up.In summary It does not tell you when you need to care for your baby,  but it does tell you when your wifi is not strong......I am looking for an alternative solution, this one is not fit for the purpose."
"2636","1","It broke with less than 3 months"
"2637","1","Do not recomend. Teice had to send back becuase old image would get stuck on screen showing baby in the crib when there was no baby in crib. Night voise poor also. Clock does not work either. Get samsung instead"
"2638","1","This was a gift. I have no idea if it's something that is good. It was on your baby registry"
"2639","1","Night vision is HORRIBLE! Can't even see baby because it is so dark and grainy"
"2640","1","Crap!!! Baby monitor just broke yesterday!!! How am you supposed to watch my baby on a monitor that doesn<U+2019>t work!!!!! I<U+2019>m so pissed I made this investment!!!!!!!"
"2641","4","Nice product, great features. Wifi lags and sometimes doesn't work at all, but could be do to slow connection."
"2642","5","Works fine but the only drawback is that camera needs to be connected to main in order for it to work."
"2643","2","Monitor feezes sometimes doesn't turn on it also flickers while on"
"2644","4","Product Was fine, it Was what i expected however the retail package was destroyed and looked terrible"
"2645","1","I had high hopes... was replacing our Summer Infant Baby Touch monitor that died after 4 years.  The motorola one has so many issues!- night vision is very lame.  It's like a bright spot light on the center of the image and the rest if much darker.- daytime vision had issues... it's like it stayed on night vision as the colors in her room didn't come across, very odd.- I hate the parent unit.  It is so touch sensitive I can't even pick it up to move it.- It beeped at me each night at 3:29am!!  No idea why, but I had to touch the screen to turn it off, and then it asked me to unlock the screen but touching the ok button - which is IMPOSSIBLE in the middle of the night without turning a light on!  Where was this screen protection earlier when I was just picking up the monitor to move it?- the internet feature didn't work well at all!!!- power cord for the camera isn't long enough, we like to place the camera on the top of a book shelf, and it had a very hard time reaching the outlet nearby.- I don't like the stand for the parent unit - was a thin stand that kicked out sidewards, personally I got used to the Summer Infant one that kicked out from the top down, and so permitted me to adjust for different angles if desired (being more or less vertical).  Also was more stable on the sofa, etc. than the Motorola one.There are probably more features I disliked but I've had it with this and just want to return and never look back.  The ONE feature that was cool was having the temperature reading in her room.  However, we have a Nest thermostat in there so was not needed.  It might have also had good range - didn't seem to have issues with that the few days I used it.  The new Summer Infant one I just got as a replacement is having some reception issues, so will see how that goes.Hope this helps!"
"2646","4","Works well"
"2647","2","Don't like it: a lot of delay for image, a lot of delay to pan/tilt, low sound, once the image/sound got frozen and we only realize about it when our baby was awake crying and the camera continue showing our baby sleeping.  The previous model that was not had didn't had all this failures; we decided to update just because the previous one felt down and crashed, as it was very good we thought this new upgraded model was going to be same as good but it was a total disappointment."

"2660","5","Great price fast shipping !"
"2661","5","Perfect!!! It works very well!"
"2662","1","It's hard for me to even put in to words how awful this thing is.  I cannot believe that we paid what we did for it, and we will be returning it tomorrow.  It is an absolute piece of junk.  My husband really wanted a baby monitor that would we could access on our phones, and I agreed that would be awesome.  But the thing is that our internet signal is just fine and the monitor still goes offline...just because!!.  There is also a separate screen you can use instead of your phone.  It's a piece of junk too.  The stand on the back broke within two days.  Plus, it makes a LOUD beeping sound every time you push a button.  So do I wake my husband up every I need to look at anything (I'm a SAHM and have the luxury to nap during the day if needed.  He works hard in an office all day and cannot be exhausted) or do I use my phone and hope the monitor doesn't go offline in the middle of the night??  There's a no win situation.  Oh and the best part is that when it goes offline...the ONLY way to fix it is to go into your child's room and unplug it and plug it back in.  Luckily, we have a toddler and just told her what we were doing.  If this was in a room with an infant, I would probably be even more livid, considering I wouldn't have known if my child was crying!!!  Luckily, my toddler just wakes up singing at about the same time every morning.  Bottom line...do not purchase this!"
"2663","5","Its perfect!"
"2664","5","Very good"
"2665","1","No parent should ever know the heartbreak of waking to learn their child has been crying for minutes, possibly hours. On these days, I awoke independently, and later than I expected, looking at the clock initially pleasantly surprised to find my children had given me the gift of sleep. This excitement was quickly crushed when I look at the monitor to discover that my tiny baby is actually awake. Awake and crying. Screaming. I frantically toss the covers aside, sprint to my baby's room and grab her sweet little hysterical body and press her close to me as quickly as possible. I analyze her perfect face for signs of how long she had been crying: redness in her face, tears or swelling in her eyes, gasping in her sweet breath. I sit and rock her, praying, PRAYING that my motherly intuition did not fail me. That I awoke after only seconds of crying. But I fear the worst. That my baby first awoke hours before. Begging for food or comfort in the middle of the night, first only stirring, then fussing, then screaming and screaming, only to return to sleep after determining hers was a need that was not going to be met. Her mother would not come on this night. Her mother may love her, but failed her in this moment. I feel a pit, deep, deep in my stomach for days after such an occurrence. I trusted the monitor. The ""baby monitor."" The machine whose only job is to monitor babies. During a critical period for neurological development and establishing attachment, I unknowingly and unwillingly did not respond to my child because of your baby monitor. A mistake for which I may never forgive myself. I may always wonder the potential long-term impact of these nights.This situation, due to a variety of failures on the part of the monitor, happened to me approximately seven times. Seven times, my baby has been crying, potentially for hours at times, and I could not hear her. These events occurred when my baby was between the ages of 3 and 5 months.  In April, I apparently purchased a faulty MBP853Connect-2 unit. I didn't begin using the unit until we moved in to our new home in June. A couple of weeks later I began to notice two issues: 1. I would occasionally find that the volume would be up in the parent unit, but I audio was transmitted, leading to discovering my baby crying without me knowing, and 2. The charger cable was loose and often fell from the parent unit. I called in July 1st and the unit was replaced under warranty. I paid around $18 shipping and kept the current unit until the new, also faulty, unit arrived.For weeks I thought I was the problem with the second unit. I would awake on my own, then notice the parent unit screen was illuminated and the scan feature was not on. I would rush to my baby.  I kept thinking I was failing to put the parent unit on the proper settings before bed and became very precise about the process, but it still kept happening. Then I saw. it. happen. I was laying in bed one evening, trying to fall asleep, and the room grew bright. I opened my eyes to discover that the parent unit was restarting. When it completed the restart, the screen stayed illuminated, and the scan feature turned off. This explained what I was experiencing. I called support and was presented with a troubleshooting option, which I completed later that day. The unit spontaneously restarted again that night. I dug my old Summer Infant monitor out and placed a second monitor in the baby's room as backup, though I feel it is absurd that this is necessary. Although the second parent unit has not had consistent issues with the volume/audio cutting out, it did happen recently, and I was able to document this occurrence, which fortunately happened with my 24-month old instead of with my more vulnerable now-six-month old. I tried to attach the video but it's in the wrong format.Motorola will never be able to rewind time to help repair what has happened between my baby and me. But I truly hope that they do something to keep it from continuing to happen to other parents.I am just your average consumer. I make purchases thoughtfully and rarely have issues.  In the event a product fails to meet my expectations, I am occasionally annoyed, though typically forgiving, and rarely, if ever, angry. Until this. Today, I am angry. Because what happened to me and my baby should happen never. Not once, not twice, but NEVER. This isn't about poor video quality, trouble with wifi or the app, or loose cables. This is about the major issues of child safety and neurological development. I beg, even demand, that you, Motorola, do your part to right this astronomical wrong, whatever the cost."
"2666","4","Great camera overall. App works as well as your internet signal will allow, but when signal is strong the reception is great. Only complaint is that we wish the range of motion for the camera was better"
"2667","1","Junk. Buy something else. Terrible product, with terrible support.Update:Constantly getting ""error loading stream id not found on server"" on the web UI. Still no resolution from customer support."
"2668","1","Completely disappointed in this monitor. With a new baby and toddler, I bought this for the 2 cameras and the remote wifi viewing. I set the first camera up and noticed that night that the lights indicating sound in the room weren't working even though I could clearly hear my toddler through the wall. On full volume, I could still hardly hear her through the monitor even when she was extremely loud. I switched out the camera with the second thinking it was maybe the camera and still hardly any sound was heard through the monitor and no light indication either. In trouble shooting, I see that this is a new product with multiple people posting the same issues. We've loved our Motorola MBP33 Wireless Video Baby Monitor we used with our toddler and so I thought sticking with another Motorola was a safe bet. I'll be returning this and on the hunt for something else,"
"2669","4","Screen flashes every minute or so"
"2670","5","The product arrived perfect and looks good! But we didn't tested yet."
"2671","1","Horrible night vision... can't see a thing on it.  Total waste of money."
"2672","4","I wasn't going to review but with so many aggressive 1-star ratings I thought I'd share our experience. We picked this set after researching every monitor out there. I liked the wifi capability so we could check in if we're out and my husband can check in from work. It's super convenient being able to use the app when you don't have the monitor in front of you. The camera works great with panning and I like the night vision. The picture isn't GREAT but I can tell if she's breathing which was my big fear when she was a newborn. You can tell if her eyes are open, she's moving, etc so I don't know what else people wanted? Haven't had any issues with the sound. You can hear like everything from the fan to kids playing outside through the speaker. I'm not crazy about the monitor design and wish it was touchscreen but that's just being picky. It's a pricey set but I think it's been worth it. It's given me peace of mind enough times to be worth every penny and I love having the camera. I'd recommend seeing for yourself if you like it!"
"2673","5","For a baby shower present."
"2674","5","So far we love it. We had a different monitor all together that was given to us as a gift that decided to stop working after 6 months. So with some research and a recommendation of Motorola we decided to order this one. So far no complaints, I love that it has the options to zoom in and out and that you can also move the camera around with the control on the screen. It has a nice features like the two way talk, which I find handy when my little one wakes and just needs to hear my voice. I also like that it has music options. By far this has already surpassed what i expected from a monitor in comparesion to our last one."
"2675","3","Picture quality at night is not as great as i would have expected at this price range,  slow to respond to panning commands and the play back when using the mobile phone is a bit slow."
"2676","5","This was a gift I gave! I understand it is working as advertised"
"2677","1","Terrible connectivity, within 12' or so the signal drops. Monitor beeps when disconnected, so it keeps us up at night more than the baby."

"2683","2","Viewing comes and goes. Didn't rate it lower because tech assistance is available."
"2684","1","This was such a disappointment.  Our three year old summer infant monitor was knocked off the shelf and finally bit the dust.  Several friends recommended Motorla monitors to us.  We need something with two camera to monitor two children in different rooms.  Having a temperature control was important to us as the kids are upstairs with a separate a/c unit.  We like to make sure they're comfortable.  The wifi capability was also appealing.Within 10 minutes of unboxing this, we knew it had to go back.  My husband and I set up one of the cameras in our son's room.  I stayed, and he went downstairs to check it out.  Here are the major issues we were not willing to deal with:1. The pan feature.  It is horrible! From the time you press the arrows to move the camera, it takes at least a couple seconds for the camera to respond.  Perhaps someone new to the whole baby monitor thing might not know this is an issue, but our old summer infant monitor could pan easily and responded instantly.2. The sound (you know...the whole reason you're monitoring your kids).  I stood about 4 feet away from the monitor and began talking at a normal volume towards the direction of the camera.  My husband couldn't hear me at all!  I went downstairs and turned the volume all the way up.  He talked right into the camera.  I could barely hear him at all.  How is this supposed to serve as a way to monitor children or babies?3. The talkback feature.  It sounded like muffled static.  :(We returned this and went with the infant optics monitor.  Although we had to buy the second camera separately, it was not an issue.  We are liking it so far."
"2685","5","I was a bit hesitant to get this Motorola 854 connect model after seeing so many mixed reviews. After a bunch of research and investigating features, I ended up trying it out to see if maybe it was improved or I would get a good apple from the bunch. I received it new in package as described, camera and monitor power on and charge and the sync was pretty easy. The camera seemed to sync automatically to the monitor and the Hubble app wasn't difficult [I did not do any of the updates]. So far so good, but I will keep using it and update if things go downhill in a couple of weeks/months."
"2686","1","My Wife and I were initially excited about this product.  Motorola is such a great company, and the video quality in the demos online looked great.  Unfortunately, our newborn spent the first few months sleeping in our room so we didn't begin using the monitor until close to the end of our return and warranty window.At first, it worked flawlessly.  It was easy to setup, connected to our WiFi network without a single hitch, and was fun to use.  The camera quality was probably average at best (I've seen other monitors since that are amazeballs!), but seeing our little guy sleeping there and being able to zoom in and see him breathing was next level.  Then, the sound on the handheld unit stopped working.  Like anyone today, I immediately tried troubleshooting the issue online.  I found a number of people with my same issue, all of whom managed to stop by Radio Shack and then solder up a new speaker.  Forget that!  I was still within the warranty period so I bailed on the online tutorials and went direct to Motorola.It took me a few hours to find and get a hold of the right people at Motorola, but once I did they sent a new handheld unit - no questions asked.  In fact, it arrived in just 2-days.  Upon setting it up, we never could quite get it to recognize Camera 1, so we had to pair our camera as a second camera with the handheld.  Once that was done, we were back in business!  The links we had added to the camera in the app didn't have to be reset either.  We could track motion and watch from our phones, tablets or desktops just like before.Then the oddest thing began happening.  A few weeks went by and the handheld unit began dropping its connection to the camera.  It mostly happened in the middle of the night.  We'd be waken up by it chirping at us.  No problem though, power-cycle the camera and we'd be back online.  I should note, our Internet connection and WiFi router are in the baby's room, so they're literally only feet away from the camera.  We also live in a one-floor condo, that's probably only 1,200 square foot - so it's not like the camera or handheld unit are ever really that far apart.  Yet, night after night, the unit would lose its connection to the camera.Shortly after that became common, the camera would cease to emit a WiFi signal.  We'd be unable to move the camera with the handheld unit, and the camera would appear 'Offline' in the iPhone app.  The process to reset the camera became somewhat of a joke.  You couldn't just power-cycle the camera because after the 'warm up' it would begin flashing red.  Holding down the 'pair' button for 3-5 seconds as instructed would initiate the pairing process, the app would find the camera, but it would not emit a WiFi signal (indicated by the intermittent flashing of red and blue).  Eventually the camera would say, ""setup failed"" and the camera would go offline.  So, back to the Internet.Apparently this is a common problem, and easily remedied.  Simply turn the camera off, hold down 'pair' and turn the camera on.  Continue holding 'pair' until the camera resets.  Then, enter the pairing mode and run setup again.  The first couple times this worked.  Once, after that, I had to delete the camera from the iPhone app and re-add it like a new camera.This became common behavior after a couple weeks.  I mean, I'm pulling down over 100 megabits in that room, and the WiFi signal strength is amazing, but the app would still warn me that the WiFi signal was weak.  The camera would also quit emitting a WiFi signal whenever it wanted.  Sure, we could still hear through the handheld unit, but we could no longer use any of the other functions such as move the camera to find our baby in his crib.So, here's the fix should this happen to you. You can reset the camera by turning it off, then holding down 'pair' and turning it back on - holding 'pair' until you hear the camera reset.  After it resets, and after the warm up, you can try pairing it again.  This will work after you've done it 12-24 times.  There's no logic to it either.  I once went through the process 18 times, re-paired the camera (but not the WiFi connection) and quit messing with it out of frustration, only to come home from work a day later and it had fixed itself.  On another occasion I removed the power cord from the camera, reset my router, reset the camera 9 times, finally got it to emit a WiFi signal and paired it without problem.  It worked for a couple days!  Other times, it will completely quit and fail to broadcast anything to the handheld.  If this happens, you can usually turn the handheld unit on and off 2-6 times and fix it.In the end, we had to call Motorola again.  They're sending a new camera, so at least their customer service has been great."
"2687","4","I just bought this (the 3.5in version) from a *large national retailer* a week ago even after the fact that I'd read all the bad reviews for it.  I'd done a ton of research on baby monitors and my other option would've likely been the Infant Optics DXR-8.  Given that the DXR-8 has been out for a couple years now and the price was still close to $200, I went with the MBP853Connect since viewing over wifi/internet was one of my main requirements and the pricing was not much different.  In fact, from the *large national retailer*, I managed to snag it for cheaper so I didn't mind giving the newer tech a try.What's great:* Video is fairly clear and smooth (although not 720p) on the 3.5in monitor - I can see enough details in the daytime and nighttime to know what my newborn is doing.* The Hubble App was easy to install and setup and allows you to watch the video in 720p over your local network or through the Internet (depends on whether you're connected to the same wifi network as the camera).  Honestly, this is the main reason I bought it and likely the main reason I'll be keeping it.* Night-time mode works pretty well and the camera switches to it automatically.  I can see the baby clear and bright in the dark.* There are physical buttons on the 3.5in version of the monitor which I prefer over the touch-based buttons on the 4.3in version.  There is no backlight, but it's not necessary since you can easily feel them in the dark.* Temperature monitor works great.  It's fairly accurate compared to what I saw for my room's thermostat. Usually higher by around 1 degrees F.* Reception is great.  I live in a 2 floor home with 1000sq.ft on each floor.  From one corner on the top floor to the opposite corner of the bottom floor, I still saw 4/4 reception bars and never lost video on the monitor.What's okay:* There is some lag in the video/audio.  I'd say around 1 second which honestly isn't that bad.  I haven't used other monitors so can't really say whether it's bad or good.* This same lag also applies to panning/rotating the camera.  I noticed a lot of reviews mention how slow it is.  You just have to press the button once, wait for it to move, then continue.  I would not hold the button hoping to move the camera to a point that you want.  It works fine for me and again, I'm not sure how much faster other monitors with panning/rotating cameras respond.* I charged up the monitor for 16 hours as recommended and used the monitor with the video-on almost 100% of the time.  I managed to snag 4hrs before it showed the 'battery low' indicator.  I'd imagine the battery life would be much better when having the video turned off and using audio only.  It's not great compared to the 8hr+ that I've read about the other monitors, but it's usable.  I have it hooked up to the power adapter most of the time beside my bed.What's not:* The speakers aren't very loud on the monitor even in the loudest volume setting so if you're in the laundry room, or cooking with the fan on, it'll be quite hard to hear the baby's noise unless the baby is crying out loud.  This isn't to say that the monitor is not picking up the sound, just that the speaker on the backside isn't very powerful.  In fact, if you put the speaker right up against your ear, you'll actually hear quite a lot of minor details including the baby's breathing. [Note: There is an AV/Speaker output so you could potentially hook up headphones to it which could help in case you're in a noisy environment]* There is a major issue with the parent monitor not having audio which I'm going to document in it's own section below.Overall:* This would be a 4-5 star product for me, but I'm giving it a 1-star mainly because of the issue I'm mentioning below.  Having audio stop working is a 'very serious' issue for a device that is advertised as providing monitoring for your precious living baby.  It should not even be sold when there is such a critical bug.  With that said, see below for more details on a potential 'workaround' that I think I have.  I'm holding onto the device to see how much longer I'm able to keep it in a working condition with the workaround and to see whether that is indeed the issue.  I may keep it still if it pans out since there are things I like about this product.  For most consumers, I'm not sure I'd recommend if this issue is not resolved.=Issue: Video works fine but audio occasionally not working on monitor=I've noticed a number of past reviews mention this same issue and it's actually quite concerning since this is the main point of having a monitor.  This product worked perfectly fine (with audio and video) for a day or so until one day, I saw my baby moving his mouth like he was crying on the video, went upstairs and heard him crying, but didn't hear anything on the monitor.  After a bunch of things that I tried, I managed to get the audio working again.I ended up spending the next day or so testing and making sure I could find a repro of the issue and it looked like the monitor occasionally ends up losing the audio when I used the 'Intercom' function.  It looks like the 'Intercom' feature works 1-way only (as advertised).  When it is pressed and held on to, audio can be sent out from the monitor but audio cannot be received until button is depressed.  So when the audio wasn't working, pressing on the 'Intercom' button again would get it back working.With that said, for now, I've completely stopped using (playing around with) the Intercom function and wanted to see how long I could go with the audio working.  It's been a couple days straight now where I haven't had issues with the audio so I'm hoping that is the culprit.[For Motorola folks who monitor these reviews, hope some of the information above helps your team out in pinpointing/fixing the issue.  I really do hope you guys fix this issue and other issues mentioned by other reviews since this product has a lot potential to do well.  I'll update my review score accordingly.]======UPDATE - January 20, 2012 [Swapped from 3.5in to 4.3in monitor]=====It's been a few months and I'd been meaning to update my review.  So, I had someone from Motorola contact me after I posted my review and they were very helpful with providing me with an exchange.  They initially wanted me to send in my device first but after explaining my situation of not being able to really live without the monitor for even a few weeks, they were willing to let me send mine in only after I received the new device.  So, as far as customer service was concerned, I had no problems what-so-ever getting my device exchanged.  The other caveat is that, they sent me the 4.3in version since they were out of stock of the 3.5in version.Therefore, my updated review is really based on the 4.3in version now but I'll still make comparisons to the 3.5in for folks that are interested in the differences.=Differences between 3.5in vs 4.3in=* SCREEN: Obviously, the screen size is different.  The 4.3in is bigger than the 3.5in but I noticed that the aspect ratio is also different.  The 4.3in is wider than the 3.5in and actually shows more content width-wise.  In other words, the 3.5in monitor is likely cropping off some of the video to it's left and right sides.  If you have the 3.5in monitor, you can also verify this by looking at the video using the Mobile App which will show the full width video.  With this regard, the 4.3in definitely gets my pick.* BUTTONS: The 4.3in monitor has mostly touch screen controls unlike the 3.5in which has physical controls.  I absolutely hate the touch screen controls since they're either very sensitive when you have to move the monitor around OR some of the buttons are not responsive when you actually want to perform an action.  Physical buttons are the way to go and the 3.5in version has my vote in this regard.* VOLUME CONTROL: The 4.3in monitor has dedicated physical buttons for volume control while the 3.5in requires you to maneuver through the menu to change volume.  This makes quite a big difference since changing the volume is probably one of my most performed actions.* MicroSD CARD INPUT: The 4.3in monitor has a microSD card slot to record videos while the 3.5in doesn't.  I haven't really used this feature to be honest so can't really comment on this but it's something to be aware if you're comparing the two.* HEADPHONE INPUT: The 3.5in monitor has a 3.5mm headphone input while the 4.3in doesn't.  I actually thought having the headphone input was a great idea for those times when you're busy mowing the lawn or doing something noisy.  Not a big deal though.* STAND: The stand on the 3.5in monitor flips out vertically while the stand on the 4.3in monitor flips out horizontally.  The 4.3in monitor's stand setup is really awkward and ends up all the way on one side of the monitor when extended which makes the monitor easy to tip over and unstable.  The 3.5in monitor's stand was perfect in that regard since it extends out more around the center.* BATTERY LIFE: The 3.5in monitor uses a 3.6V 900mAh battery and I was able to get around 4+ hours with the monitor fully on.  The 4.5in monitor uses a 3.7V 1880mAh battery and I'm not able to get around 8+ hours.  This was another huge differentiating factor for me.Besides the main differences above, the 4.3in monitor's performance in terms of video quality & reliability, range & reception, night-time mode, internet video, is about the same as the 3.5in monitor.  Great in both cases.  I've never had range issues, or video getting cut off.I had previously mentioned about my 3.5in monitor having a serious issue with sound getting disabled after using the Intercom feature which was the main reason I exchanged the product.  I'm unable to say whether they've fixed that in the 3.5in version of the monitors (since I got mine exchanged with the 4.3in) or whether a few of us just got unlucky with a faulty batch but so far, I've not encountered this issue with the 4.3in version.In summary, given that customer service has exchanged mine faulty 3.5in with a 4.3in with no issues, I'm updating my review from 1 star to 4 stars, specifically for the 4.5in (MBP854CONNECT) version .  Compared to all the other monitors out there, I still believe this monitor is one of the best for the right price.  The Video-over-Internet feature is still my biggest selling point and to be honest, after 3 months of use, I am using it mainly to watch my baby over my iPhone or on my laptop whenever I forget my monitor somewhere in the house.  It also comes in handy, when your monitor runs out of battery."
"2688","5","GREAT!!!"
"2689","1","latency issues on both handheld monitor & from internet wifi"
"2690","5","I chose this baby monitor with two cameras for both of my babies. I wanted a camera set that would allow a WiFi option so that I could see away from home or if I was out of range of the monitor but within the home WiFi. The option of viewing from my cellular network is nice too. Came in handy- recently my in-laws were having some issues with our infant crying. (We tried calling them but their cell phone sometimes does not ring and goes to voicemail. We were able to speak to them through the camera. It's not ideal but we were able to communicate to tell them the baby is crying because of tired not hungry.)The camera system requires a good quality wifi setup so if your wifi is skechy then this may not be for you. When our wifi is down we can use the monitor but the signal does not seem as strong. Initial setup was a little interesting but if you have trouble you can alway contact Motorola support. Once you install make sure you update the cameras firmware through the iphone app. There have been several updates that may have an impact on the system working properly.The directional controls on the camera are a little clunky but they seem to be getting better with updates.The volume when using via wifi on my iphone is great! In fact I haven't used the actual monitor lately because its just easier to use with iphone. Although its nice to have the monitor as a third option if one of us or the in-laws are on a different floor and need to view.Camera quality in light is great.Low light is okay. Much to what I would expect.Night vision is okay. Seems to do the job.Overall this has been a good experience. It meets the needs for my family.  I may expand this to a third camera to monitor the main floor and/or outside when we sleep.Lastly the Hubble customer service is great!I noticed some of the negative reviews.  I think a large part of it is user error.  You need Wifi to get the full benefit. You need to download latest firmware. Lastly CALL tech support if you cannot figure out. The tool free number is on a card when you open camera."
"2691","5","Good"
"2692","5","Good product!"
"2693","5","We just had a baby and I searched and searched for monitors while my wife was pregnant.  None seemed to be perfect, and I really wanted to have it all.  With this one, I think I have everything I wanted.  Granted, the price is very high, but for the money it delivers.  Large screen, internet connectivity, great infrared camera, pan/tilt/zoom, talk back to room, temperature monitoring, and lots more.Let's start with the basics. The camera is the standard ""orb style"" with a ring of infrared LED around a regular camera lens.  There is an on/off switch and a pair button on the bottom but that is it for buttons.  The base has 2 keyhole style holes so you can mount is on the wall and the base feels sturdy enough to stand fine on a bookcase or shelf.  The power cord has a mirco-usb connector at the end of a long cord with a standard wall-wart on the end.  Motorola strongly encourages that you use only their plug, but if in a pinch or traveling with it, don't quote me but I imagine you could use a replacement.  It's just nice that it's not a proprietary plug that if you lose it you have to buy directly from Motorola.The parent unit is nicely made and has a big screen but at the same time is fairly thin.  It also uses a micro-usb cord to charge it (the wall-plugs are identical, no markings to distinguish one from the other).  There is a small kick-stand on the back and the package comes with a white stand to use on the nightstand.  The stand has a place to lock in the charging cable but otherwise does not connect to the parent unit.  It just sits nicely on the stand, which makes it easier to disengage- you just pick it up.There are touch buttons around the outside of the screen to move the camera, turn off the screen, pull up the menu, etc.  I wish the ""up/down/left/right/ok"" buttons could have been in one place like the center of most remotes for TV rather than left/right on one side of the screen and up/down on the other, but it's a small gripe.  The only physical buttons are the volume up/down and the power off button.The functionality is great.  The screen is very good, especially when you consider what it is and what it is designed to do.  A Samsung Note or iPhone 6 screen this ain't, but you don't need to look at megapixels, you need to make sure your baby is safe. This does that, and more pixels would make the refresh time slower, anyway.  The sound is very good, about as good as you could expect from a small device.  You can hear background noises like fans or the outside, which goes away if you lower the volume a bit.  Once you get it set right, the only thing you hear is the noises you want to hear like the baby. All of these monitors have a bit of a delay and this one is no different.  That being said, it's fine to monitor your baby, and again, that's why you bought this in the first place.As for the internet connectivity, it uses an app called Hubble which is available for Android and iPhone.  The download and install were simple and setting up an account was very easy.  Once set up you just press the ""pair"" button on the bottom of the camera and it connects to your wi-fi then to the app. The app is very easy to use, you can control the camera just like with the parent unit and you can even use the app to talk to the room with the camera.  The talk-back function (whether on the parent unit or the app) is like a walkie-talkie not a phone so it's one way at a time but it worked well in my tests. You do have to have good, robust wi-fi in the room where you want to use this camera or it won't connect to the app.  The parent unit and the camera work fine if there is no wi-fi, but the app needs to be connected to the router.  The app will notify you when there is movement or sound and will let you know when the room temp goes above or below a certain temp.The camera can play music which can be controlled by the parent unit or the app.  The music was surprisingly good, not as tinny and cheap sounding as I thought it might be.  Concert quality? No, but very good for a tiny little speaker on a wireless camera that also has wi-fi and a thermometer.  If you keep your expectations realistic, then you will be nicely surprised by this one.This is a feature-loaded, very nicely made monitor.  It has more bells and whistles than you may need but you'd be surprised how many of them you'll end up using.  The parent unit could be a bit better designed and the lag could be a bit shorter but in the end you want it to check on your baby from home or away and it does just that.  If you are in the high-end of the market, this delivers for the price.Edit 02-23-15: I have used the monitor for about 3 weeks and the only comment I would make now is the speaker on the monitor is very quiet and the sounds from the room are hard to hear even when the parent unit is turned all the way up. If you're using it when sleeping only, you will probably hear everything you want to hear. However, if you are using it when around the house while the baby is napping, you will have a hard time hearing the quieter sounds over the TV, etc. You'll still hear the crying (I think you can hear my baby on Jupiter) but it's sometimes good to attend to your baby before the crying stage.Not enough to reduce the number of stars (I think this is still worth 5), but it might come close to knocking a star off."

"2697","1","If I could give this negative stars I would.  I have never been so disappointed in an electronic.  This is seriously garbage.  My first set (yes I'm on my second because the first crapped out within a few months and stopped charging along with having some of the issues listed below)  Since the beginning this monitors wifi has not worked correctly, but that's not the worst of my issues.  Oh no, first, when we try to pan and tilt the camera will continue moving without us touching the screen.  I will push down and once I let go it begins going up again until the camera is all the way up.  The zoom continually un-zooms randomly and sometimes won't work.  This monitor has WOKEN myself and my husband up over 2 dozen times, in the past 2 months alone.  The camera will disconnect and it never fails that it happens at 3-4am and the monitor then begins loudly beeping and has to be reset.  For 2 parents who are finally sleeping at night this is by far the worst thing this does.  Additionally, when you turn the monitor off to save battery the clock does not continue counting so every time you turn it back on you have to reset the settings AGAIN, and AGAIN.  Currently, my screens black and white night feature no longer wants to work so it's now pink.  2 days ago, the sound decided to randomly turn off (volume was almost to full) but the sound stopped working and I failed to hear my kid for about 30 mins when he was crying.  I originally paid $300.00 for this piece of garbage and you'd think for that price you'd have a good working monitor system.  I contacted Motorola about my current issues and they will not refund me but simply send, yet another replacement which I am refusing because I HATE this monitor system.  Please, stay away from this set it belongs in the trash more than your home and it will only bring you headaches and torment!!!!!"
"2698","1","We use to have the old version of this camera and it when it broke, I just ordered another one. Let me tell you, the ratings are correct, they changed the manufacturing on this camera and it is now a POS. Why am I writing this review at 4 in the morning you ask? Probably because the monitor didn<U+2019>t pickup the noise of my daughter crying (I haven<U+2019>t even set up WiFi yet so I<U+2019>m talking about to the parent monitor) and her crying was so loud it woke me up from the other room. The baby is sharing a room with the toddler and it seems like ever since we got this monitor, someone has been waking up at 4 am. (A week ago) I would just grab whichever girl was crying and bring them to our room. Well, I decided to stay and rock the baby in the bedroom to discover that the CAMERA must be set to an alarm at 4 AM cause the thing was STROBE lighting in there! (Bright light blinking very brightly) Literally no one could sleep through what I saw before I ripped that plug out of the wall with a string of curses. Thanks Motorola for the lack of sleep. You<U+2019>ve made my house a nightmare for the past week. Also, if you<U+2019>re still thinking of buying this camera (don<U+2019>t do it!!) the camera quality during the night is awful. My baby just looks like a blob, you can<U+2019>t see her face at all. <U+201C>But I see some of the ratings have great picture quality.<U+201D> That<U+2019>s because people like me use to have the old version of the camera (exact same model number but a DIFFERENT manufacturer) and we posted those pictures with the OLD camera. Don<U+2019>t trust them; this is not the same camera I use to have... and I haven<U+2019>t even set up the WiFi yet."
"2699","1","We have tried all kinds of baby monitors and this one is BY FAR the worst one we've tried.  We purchased it because it allows viewing from a mobile device and comes with a monitor.  However, the app constantly buffers and times out with this camera, even when the others we have sitting right beside it to test work fine.  When viewing from either the app or the monitor the image quality is horrible compared to the other cameras.  The frame rate is just terrible, you're lucky to get 5 frames a second over WiFi.  And the viewing angle absolutely sucks for a baby camera.  We expected a LOT more from a brand like Motorola, we are sorely disappointed and hope you'll safe yourself the frustration and avoid this camera, or better yet any camera from Motorola.PS - Our favorite baby monitor is the LeNest WiFi Wireless 720p HD IP Camera Remote.  There are many just like it but we got it because it only costs $30 (on sale at the time) and can run for days without buffering sitting right beside this Motorola which constantly buffers and loses connection to the camera.  The image and audio quality is MUCH more clear.  The app for the LeNest is so much better than the Motorola Hub app that it makes you laugh when you use the Motorola app again.  The frame rate on the LeNest is great, at least 15 fps if not 30 over WiFi. Since the LeNest doesn't have a separate monitor or Pan/Tilt you may say it's apples to oranges, but I would say for the price of this Motorola piece-of-you-know-what you could buy 8 LeNest cameras to cover every angle and you'd be much happier at the end of the day!I would return it in a second if it was possible, unfortunately we bought it over a month before our little one came so we didn't find out just how bad it sucks until it was too late to return.  Save yourself the headache and a few bucks by choosing a cheaper, better baby monitor!"
"2700","1","WiFi and Broadband is now limited to 5 minutes. HUBBLE DISCONNECTS AFTER FIVE MINUTES!!! Are you kidding me???? Just invest some money in your network for the love of God!AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE!This is what a sinking ship looks like.** These are NOT even Motorola! **In 2015, Binatone Global paid for the rights to manufacture, market and sell their cameras under the Motorola brand as if they WERE Motorola.  The result has been that most of the Binatone cameras made from 2015 on have an ALARMING fail rate at 2-4 months with very few of them crossing 12 months. With the atrocious quality of these Binatone pieces of junk, its almost bordering on false advertising.  In fact there currently is a class-action lawsuit being set up. **** CAMERA STARTED TO CATCH FIRE!!! Details At the End **CAMERA IS NOT AS ADVERTISED - NO HD video, NO 720, NO IR AS PROMISEDBottom Line Upfront: Read the reviews, older cameras worked great because they were made in a different factory then the ones sold now.  The older Cameras with a VT1411 in the beginning of their serial numbers are from before Binatone  KNOWINGLY AND INTENTIONALLY ""downgraded"" the cameras while continuing to sell them as if they were the Older Motorola version.Got this FROM MOTOROLA after I returned the 8th replacement attempt and sent them the attached video comparison... as pictures show you everything...""The older cameras had a higher drive level to the IR LED<U+2019>s and in turn do not have the range of the newer cameras that you have. I tested the cameras that you returned and get results similar to what you provided.""They advertise this as having ""8 Infrared (IR) LED Emitters"" - this is false for many batches.  The factory in CHINA (you know where this is going) that they are using has a known history in the CCTV industry (I should know, I'm in that industry) of having over a 60% defect rate in their production... so why does Binatone use them??? Because they are the rock bottom cheapest.In the attached pictures you can see what 8 IR emitters looks like with Cameras 1 and 2. Cameras 5-8 when I finally started documenting this, the IR LEDS are not even working or are not even in the unit (CHINA MANUFACTURING IS KNOWN FOR FRAUD - and apparently proud of it). Using an IR meter, with cameras 5-8, the best I ever recorded on IR illumination was 40% of what Cameras 1 and 2 put out. As evidenced from the email line above, they know this.This product is bad... and getting worse every day.  Sort the reviews in order of most recent... it becomes very evident that Binatone is imploding. Wonder when Motorola will stop letting Binatone use/trash their name.The Full Story (Will Be Updated as Things Continue)- Got this as a gift for my son's birthday July 2015- From the first day, the Hubbleconnected website only worked about 50% of the time...at best.- By December I was having to reset the cameras every day; By February several times a day- By March the portable monitor was superimposing all of my cameras on top of each other- By April the portable monitor failed totally and my cameras would having issues STOPPING panning and tilting during aimingAPRIL 25, 2016replacement display and monitor from Binatone. Refurb on the display... 2x new cameras- Both ""new cameras"" had their IR emitters dead out of the box. Glad I did not send my old ones in - even though they were auto-panning at times, at least I could see my son in the dark- The monitor appears to work... will let you know how the requested THIRD set goes.MAY 1, 2016THIRD set of cameras arrives- Once again, both cameras were junk out of the box.  Either the IR emitters are bad... or just not there.  Which would not surprise me given its made in China which is known for shoddy workmanship and charging companies for things they never do or never put in.- Once again, Binatone is sending me a set of cameras... this will be attempt #4!MAY 21, 2016FOURTH set of cameras (Camera 7 & 8)- Once again, junk out of the box.- Each camera took over 10 attempts to pair- Each camera failed IR test.  I am convinced that Motorola has just stopped putting IR in the cameras or is KNOWINGLY putting less than 8 IR LEDS in the camera... since they are aware of the problems with the cameras... and still do nothing... they are responsible.- Will be sending back and getting cameras 9 and 10.JUNE 16, 2016- Binatone is REFUSING to send me anymore cameras and admitted that the new cameras do not have the same resolution or night vision IR as the old ones and therefore will never be able to get me a replacement of ""the same or better quality"" which is violation of US LAW under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act AND the Fair Business Act.SEPTEMBER 12, 2016New Cameras 9 & 10 were sent out having been made, supposedly to different specs and date stamped from June 2016.  IR was almost back to the quality of the 2014 cameras... not as good, but better picture quality under low light... so the trade off is acceptable.JANUARY 23, 2017Camera 9 started to have issues with its color switching between color and black & white.  When coming up from black & white it would come up with a yellow tint image or a blue tint image... it would sometimes go full color. Then it started to power cycle itself. By the time i got on a ladder it was hot to the touch and smelling of burning electrics.Like I said before, shoddy workmanship and poor quality. This will get a child and their family hurt.  Just imagine what could have happened if this camera which was over my son<U+2019>s crib, caught fire while he was sleeping and feel into his crib, trapping him as it set fire to his blankets.  Not good, Binatone<U+2026> not good at all.FEB 2, 2017Replacement camera #11 arrived - on the same day that Camera #10's imager failed just like the other one.  Instead of waiting for it to start to smoke, I just pulled it and set it aside... now waiting on Replacement #12 in less than two years.MARCH 20, 2017Two new cameras (#12 & #13) and handheld monitor (#3) were received and are running now. So far, so good - for the hardware.The monitor stays in sleep mode as it should and both cameras have GREAT IR... even better than my original first two. While I am happy about this, it does support what you read here in other posts that there is a quality consistency problem. So far the CCD imagers are working fine as well. Now we just have to get them to last beyond 4-6 month... or 2 weeks as was the case with one batch.23 MARCH, 2017Cameras and handheld still fine, however, massive latency issues when using Hubble. Obviously at bandwidth capacity... again. Hubble's solution is to disconnect you after 5 minutes. That's right... you read that correctly. If you have the version without the handheld or if you intend to monitor over Hubble, you have to ""okay"" continued monitoring via Hubble every 5 minutes or your app shuts down. Forget even trying to contact Hubble, they have no support.... the Saga Continues."
"2701","1","Not impressed. The unit seemed pretty cool at first but literally after one day it started failing. The connection between the monitor and the camera kept getting interrupted and this horrible beeping noise would go off on the monitor each time it occurred. It was a nightmare. While I did like the monitor size and features the connection issues were horrible and probably due to interference with other devices like iPads and iPhones which all households have. Also the Hubble app was a piece of crap I tried everything and was never able to get the app to work with the camera after attempting numerous times and updating the firmware, etc. shouldn't be that hard. I returned the system and got a nest."
"2702","2","I purchased this item at target, and I was completely torn between this or buying the nest cam.I absolutely love this product when it works... when. it works. It has a hard time keeping the camera connected and/or finding the camera. Multiple times a day I have to reconnect it and delete the camera. I dont think I would mind this except when it is not connected both the camera and the video unit make this obnoxious beeping noise... and of course this 98% of the time occurs when your child is sleeping. Thus this noise startles your baby and wakes him/her up.The video also seems to pause, multiple times i checked the camera to make sure he was still breathing and there was no movement- I went up stairs to check and he was fine, the video just froze. It does this frequently too. I initially was only using this unit at night when I put him down for bed and so my husband and I could keep an eye on him during dinner or tv time. So i would turn the units off when I was done - but again, if I did that I would have to reconnect the camera to the video unit when I turned it on again. This is annoying but now it just remains on 24/7, wasting electricity.I also purchased this item because I liked that my husband could also peak in on him during work via their app. Their app is also awful. It is buggy and works when it wants to, and again, the video freezes or gets supper sticky.Pros: I like that you can see the temperature, fairly accurate withing 2-3 degrees. I enjoy that you can play music to the cam from the main unit, or you can speak into it. And when the app does work, I like that too.Would I purchase this again, no, not unless some serious fixes were in place."
"2703","1","As I sit here and write this review it is currently 1.30am and the monitor won't stop beeping because it is losing connection to the camera constantly. Now, I have gone through every troubleshooting method with Motorola customer support which takes about 6 hours and they have no resolution. A few weeks ago it just decided to go black and not do anything. Then a week later just turned on by itself again. I HATE this monitor. Also, I should note the connection has nothing to do with our Wi-Fi but I wish it did because we have some seriously stable Wi-Fi at our house that God knows how far and the camera would probably work much better. Don't even get me started on the hubble app it supposedly connects to....Don't waste your time, money, or precious hours if sleep on this thing. It was bought as a gift on our registry from babies r us but they were unable to help and it was purchased to long ago and Motorola does not stand by it's products. I should note we didn't have a need for a monitor until our lo was about 6 months so after baby shower time and whatnot it was too late. It started having problems weeks after we started using it and no one will help and we can't get a new one from Motorola.  So now I have to go buy a new 200 monitor and hope to the high heavens that I won't be in this situation again."
"2704","2","ConsPoor battery lifePoor picture quality unless uses through the app.3 second delayNo touch screen and with most phones being touch screens these days I am very used to hitting the screen.It has infrared night vision but if room is really dark it is very hard to see the picture unless viewing through wifi with hubble app on phone or tablet where the quality is much betterComparing this monitor to the one I was previously using which was much less expensive than this one, I have to say the only con on my previous monitor was not having wifi and being able to use the hubble app which has some really great features. My cheaper monitor the quality of picture is better. The battery life is better. It doesn't have a 3 second delay and has touch screen.ProsWifi hubble appNotifies you when the room is too hot or cold or there is sound or movement in room.  Also takes a screen shot of the activity with the time it happened.Acts as security camera so you can check in on baby or pets and i love the 2 way communication feature especially through the app.I don't think it's really worth the price I think there are better cameras out there with the wifi hubble app feature that don't have all those cons."
"2705","1","I don't mind if my baby wakes me up, but literally every single night *while our baby is finally sleeping quietly*, this monitor beeps loudly and wakes me up, interrupting the few precious hours or minutes of sleep that I do try to get. It is beeping as loud as an alarm to alert us that the battery is dying, even though IT IS PLUGGED IN!!!The cord is weighted. I have tried placing the Monitor AND the cord on the nightstand, so that the weight of the cord is not pulling over the edge and becoming disconnected that way, but it still beeps. I have tried placing it flat, face up, and it still beeps. I have tried placing it face down on the nightstand so that the cord is more likely to stay balanced inside of the port, even though I can't see the baby this way, and it still beeps. I have also tried to wrap the cord around it to hold it in place, or gently place small items under to support the weight of the cord so that it does not become disconnected from the port, but it still beeps. The cord itself is very heavy and no matter what I do, its connection to the port is not consistent, and it continually wakes me up every single night. I am furious. We need our sleep!!!"
"2706","1","I bought this during a Black Friday sale at the end of November 2016 for my baby due in February. Ye baby slept in my room for a couple of months, so this wasn<U+2019>t used until April 2017. Within a couple of weeks, I was so mad I emailed Motorola about my problems. Those problems began with the plug not staying in as others complained of in the reviews. I could rig the monitor on my bedside table to have the cord to lay <U+201C>just so<U+201D> and it would receive a charge, so I thought I could live with it. In all honesty, I was probably sleep deprived and too tired to deal with contacting the company. Then one morning I woke early to realize I hadn<U+2019>t heard my baby in a while. I look at the monitor to realize I couldn<U+2019>t see him. He was covered in the blanket I had draped over his legs. I run upstairs to find him crying, drenched in sweat, flailing his legs trying to get out from under the blanket. It was so pitiful I cried. Now, I know blankets shouldn<U+2019>t be in the crib and that was the last time I put one in with him. I guess I assumed since he wasn<U+2019>t mobile and I only placed it over his legs & sleep sack that it wouldn<U+2019>t matter. Plus, I had a baby monitor on high volume to alert me if my baby was in distress, right? Wrong. When I went back to look, the volume was turned up on the monitor, but no sound was coming out. Only after powering off and back on did the sound come back. I was livid and shot off an email to Motorola. They didn<U+2019>t apologize or seem to understand the gravity of what had happened. They did agree to a replacement handheld piece, though. Within a couple weeks, I received a replacement monitor and cord to be used with the camera we already had.For the last 8 months the device has worked for the most part. There have been issues with the sound turning off and the annoying beeping when the monitor is out of range from the camera has woken us up for no apparent reason more times than necessary. For the sake of higher priorities or perhaps laziness, I guess, we have hung in there. Then last night, after days of ongoing out of range beeping for no reason, the plug stopped fitting into the monitor again. So, last night, at 2:30am, it started beeping a different beep. It was a low battery beep, because the plug wasn<U+2019>t fitting properly and after several hours of being plugged in it was losing charge. I had to get up, test plug sockets, only to realize the micro usb just wasn<U+2019>t fitting properly again. Ugh!!!!Even though I got this monitor for $150, I wouldn<U+2019>t buy it again for $20. The technology and picture quality are average at best. Even though the company sent me a recplscement, it was only after a robot like encounter & weeks of waiting. No product should need a replacement twice in a year. More importantly, when relying on a device to monitor a baby, you expect something to be dependable to help keep your child safe. You want it to be an accessory to life, not a regular annoyance.I bought this brand after it was recommended from family. It is possible that this is just a bad model, but after this encounter I wouldn<U+2019>t buy anything else from Motorola. I had a Summer brand for my daughter which worked for 3 years without fail. I had a Withings with my other son that had its issues but none like this. All in all, this was a fail and no new parent should buy this monitor."
"2707","4","Purchased this camera in spring 2015 and have been using it for over a year now. Have to say I am surprised by all of the negative reviews - we are pretty happy with the camera. Video quality is good, not great, but then again I wasn't expecting HD quality video. I can make out whether or not my child is breathing in night vision mode, which is good enough for me. The Hubble app is also convenient, especially for when we want to check in on things during the day at work. Also it's durable - over the last few weeks the camera has been knocked down a ton (my one year old has discovered she likes knocking the camera down off the top of her crib. Word to the wise - buy a shelf!) and it still works.We did run into an issue with the sound failing on the handheld monitor but resetting the monitor seems to have fixed it. Every now and then the Hubble server will act up and you cannot access the events history, but it has not interfered with real-time viewing. And there is a slight delay in the video feed (maybe a second or two), especially when adjusting the camera. Otherwise we are really happy with the purchase!"
"2708","1","Absolutely the worse product, EVER!"
"2709","1","Even the monitor that came with it doesn't work.  How does it's own screen not work?  I'm in the next room over and it still doesn't get a signal.  The app worked for about a minute before it lost connection.  It's laughable how bad this camera is.  Fortunately I bought this at Best Buy so I can easily return it but wow I'm really disappointed in Motorola.  Not only that but the adapters that came with it are not compatible with any outlet baby cover because the plug mounts to the side.  Fortunately it's just a micro usb plug so it was easy to find something else that could power it but my last baby monitor camera cane with a plug that fit in there and I shouldn't have to buy power adapters and cords.  UPDATE:  now the sound doesn't work.  How can the sound not work on a baby monitor?  That's the most basic function of a baby monitor.  There's also no visual indicator of sound, no lights that light up when sound is detected like every other baby monitor on the market.  The zoom doesn't zoom in very far either like other baby monitors.  We have already ordered a baby monitor made by another company, an older model we had before.  It really seems like this is not meant to be a baby monitor, it's a wifi camera with it's own monitor, because it has nothing a normal baby monitor has, like a good zoom (even if digital, better than nothing), the lights to show the sound level, etc.  But this is one of the most expensive baby monitors on the market.  And the app says the camera is offline for some reason.  This is the worse purchase I've ever made"
"2710","5","I wanted to write a review on this baby monitor because it has so many negative reviews! I debated for along time about getting this monitor because it did have such a low rating but it is the only monitor with every feature that I wanted!! Such as two way audio, temperature,motion, and sound monitoring, and of course the app with wifi!!! My husband and I love this monitor! I'm a nurse and work night shift so when I'm at work I can check in on him anytime while he is sleeping!! I also love that I get notifications to my phone when he is crying or moving about in his crib!! I haven't had any problems with the wifi or the app! So if your looking for a monitor with everything then you should give this one a try because it is awesome and worth the money!"
"2711","2","I've had the same issues other reviewers stated. The camera occasionally loses wifi connection and I have to pair it all over again either with the monitor it comes with or it will go offline on the app. If a simple repairing doesn't work then I have to reset my wifi router which is a pain because then the printers have to be re-paired too. The range only works in the house. Beyond that is out of range and wifi can be spotty at times but I gave it 2 stars because it's better than a couple other brands I tried. The monitor didn't boot up right out of the package so I had to hit the reset button about 20 times before it would boot up. We bought an extra camera to add to the monitor unit and that camera's night vision didn't work and we had to return it. The motion sensor goes off as soon as sunlight hits the room and continues to go off until I turn off the notifications. The notifications work well for a day or two but then I don't get any at all for a long time using the wifi on my phone. Then randomly they work again. There is a second or two delay on the monitor from real time. To turn the monitor on, you have to hold the on button for quite a while until the screen lights up. The buttons sometimes don't sense your finger and you have to reboot the monitor. The monitor occasionally freezes on an image and you have to hit a top button to get live feed. First time this happened I thought my baby had stopped breathing so I ran in to find him sitting up and awake. There are so many issues with this product you would expect more for the price. But like I said, it's the best wifi one that I could find that has the on and tilt function. My sister has the same one and the same issues. She called customer service and they wanted her to send the defective monitor back before they would send a new one. So you'll be without one so you might as well buy a different one. I have a Samsung brand non-wifi as a backup that works great. Motorola has a ways to go. I expect more from this brand."
"2712","5","Very nice monitors that have great picture and great features, like temp and the ability to talk back. This makes these monitors useful ""watchful eyes"" for much longer than just a ""baby monitor"". After reading the other reviews, it is clear to me that the WiFi in your home and the potential things that interfere with normal wifi create some reliability and quality issues.Set up is relatively easy and the two camera set up is great so you can view from different angles or multiple locations (twins!!).Again, the secret to getting a good signal and using all the cool features that these cameras can handle through the hubble app is dependent upon your wifi signal.This is the techy part: (get the free android app: WiFi Analyzer)I used a android app called wifi analyzer to find the frequencies that were overlapping my signals. This also helped me find the best spots to place the cameras so I could get the best reception. The db page was especially helpful for placement. If you have iOS, you will have to find another wifi program to find the strength of your signal ...Get a good location without a lot of interference and your monitor will work great."
"2713","3","PICTURE QUALITY: This system isn't FaceTime or Skype. The camera resolution is lower than you'd expect, meaning that the view is a little grainy, especially when the night vision kicks in. For example, I found the video quality sufficient to see if my child had kicked off the covers, but not good enough to see her chest rising and falling. The night vision works fine when the lights are off, but it kicks in even when there is a reading lamp on. The room has to have overhead light or bright sunlight to take advantage of the high-def color video.AUDIO is set on a time-lag. When you talk to the speaker, there is enough time to say five words before it transmits. You can soothe your kid, but don't expect to have a meaningful conversation.VIEWING: The view is set by four dedicated buttons on the parent unit. When you press the button to pan or tilt, the camera moves a predetermined number of degrees. There is no ""nudge"" button. The rest of the interface is mostly menu-driven and some features are buried more deeply than I'd prefer.The HUBBLE feature turns the baby monitor into a low resolution surveillance camera which you can monitor from your iPhone. I logged into the Hubble app from my phone and was able to view camera snapshots when motion was detected. If you want to record what time your dog got walked or your plants got watered, then this set-up is for you.OTHER FEATURES: My favorite feature is the built-in THERMOMETER display. No more worrying about whether the room is too hot or too cold. My least favorite feature is the warning beep to tell you that the camera is out of range from the receiver. Inexplicably, this alarm went off in the middle of the night, when neither the camera or the monitor had moved. Unfortunately, this alarm didn't coincide with a feeding time. There doesn't seem to be any way to turn this feature off. To avoid future interruptions, I muffled the sound by taping over the speaker unit.Note: the Hubble website seems to be doing a slow roll-out. At the time of writing this, I could not log in from my desktop and the video recording plan/storage doesn't seem to be live yet. I'd like to see what the camera looks like on a full-sized video screen. This will be a four-star product once Hubble is full-featured."
"2714","2","I really wanted this camera to work out, but it's fairly expensive and performs only marginally. The main reason I wanted this camera was for the WiFi connection and to view it remotely. However, I am only able to view remotely less than 25% of the time. When using Hubble, it keeps searching and trying to make a connection, and very rarely does it make one.  When you're viewing the camera with the parent unit, there is a lot of static noise and it sounds terrible (even when I'm just in the next room). One time, the audio came through the parent unit but the video never did. I had to sneak back in the baby room and quietly turn on and off the camera to try and reset it. Finally after doing that, the video showed up.Bottom line: If I knew then what I know now about this camera,, I wouldn't put it on my baby registry, I wouldn't buy it, nor would I recommend it to anyone."
"2715","2","Poorly designed product. I was expecting higher quality from Motorola. I'd recommend purchasing other options.Cons:- Touch buttons are nearly impossible to operate in darkness- The options and programming is flimsy- No easy way to lock up/reprogram wifi for the camera unless you download the mobile app. In this day and age - there should be ability to lock up/disable wifi access from monitor.- Monitor battery dies fairly quickly- Thermometer readings are usually off- All of a sudden, the video recorder option stopped working.- The intercom function is too easy to accidentally press and startle anyone in the room with the monitor. There should be ability to disable/enable some functions- Blinking Red LED is annoyingPros:- the monitor and camera are fairly durable. Survived falls.- night vision works well- decent range"
"2716","2","Received this as a baby shower gift and have been using for 2 years now. Initially did a lot of research and thought this would be the one for our new baby, we wanted the WiFi, night vision, temp, pan/tilt..  etc. does all that just fine.What this does best - let<U+2019>s you see your baby.Almost all of the features work as stated, however... the lost signal/low battery beep is SO LOUD. Our house is tiny and we can hear baby so we have the monitor volume completely off just use for the camera. Finally baby sleeps thru the night and randomly signal is lost and the alert is so loud it<U+2019>s waking us up. There are other monitors whose descriptions boast the feature to turn this alert off. MOTOROLA PLEASE! Software update!!! Here<U+2019>s what we want! <U+201C>Beeping Warnings Gone... new software where the 'beeping' warning alerts (out of range, low battery) can be toggled off under menu options.<U+201D>I can understand technology randomly loses signal with all he interferences around, it comes back momentarily, but if my volume is off, I SHOULDNT HEAR IT! Please give the option to override!!! That<U+2019>s my biggest complaint and many times I<U+2019>ve shut it off at night and not even used it bc as people with little babies know... sleep is few and far between sometimes and when baby is out you should be too! Many times I<U+2019>ve almost replaced the entire system because of this lost signal beep and frequency, but we just can<U+2019>t justify the $.<U+201D> When the Fix seems so easy on the development end.Clock won<U+2019>t ever keep time as the parent monitor doesn<U+2019>t store this when the monitor is turned off or shuts down delm low battery. Not a big deal to us but I know it annoys some. Seems like an easy fix on Motorola<U+2019>s end for newer models.Hubble app was crap two years ago, could barely ever get camera to load. A few updates since then have made it ok. We have made use of logging in while away to check house temperature when we had boiler issues and it was a lifesaver.Motorola customer service has helped out a few times when cameras stopped connecting and have needed to be re-paired, or parent monitor stopped working and have been replaced. Typical customer service and response was good, just FIX THE ALERTS! Just want to be able to silence them. PLEASE!!"
"2717","3","We did a lot of research about monitors before we purchased this one. My husband wanted one that we would have to use our phones or a tablet with, over wifi, and I was concerned that if our wifi/internet went out, which does happen on occasion, we would lose connection with the camera, and have no idea that our daughter was crying in her room. We decided on this one because it seemed to be the best of both worlds - we could use our phones or a tablet if we wanted to, but throughout the night we would have the reliability of the monitor, and not have to use our phones or our tablet throughout the night..... Or so we thought. We didn't start using this until my daughter was about 4 months old. We set it up for her naps, because otherwise, she's still sleeping in our room. I noticed the first day we used it that I heard her crying in the next room before I heard it on the monitor. There was no sound coming out of the monitor. I picked it up and you could faintly hear a tiny peep coming out of the monitor, yet my daughter was crying pretty loudly. I figured it must be the sound machine (Dohm sound conditioner, works like a charm), so we tried turning that off. Nope. We tried repositioning the microphone. Nope. The camera is much closer to her in our room than it will be when she's in her crib, so that's even more concerning.... Occasionally, the sound on this barely works, as in, if I am sitting in silence working on my computer, and she starts to cry, I can hear it on the monitor, but I can also just hear that through the walls. I would never trust this monitor while I am sleeping, even though I am an extremely light sleeper, that's how quiet it is. The whole reason we bought this was for when we move our daughter to her own room, and right now, with this monitor, that's not happening. It works better on the app on our phones, but I wouldn't trust that throughout the night. I really want to like this monitor because it has so many great features, and I really do think it's the best one out there, but our monitor does not work like it should. Also, on ours, the lights do not light up on the top. It just has the one green light always light up and that's it, no matter how much noise is happening on the other end. It is also always in night mode, no matter how bright the room is. I don't know if the room never gets bright enough, but I feel like that's not the issue.... Anyhow, if our monitor worked right and like it should, this would be a 5 star review, because this system has the potential to be the best. I feel like maybe we just got a bad one, but I have seen other reviews similar to ours. Maybe there was a bad batch of these monitors?"
"2718","4","We're really happy with the purchase.  We got the version with just the camera, so this review isn't about the monitor screen.  We had gone into the store to buy another monitor which was out of stock, but then we saw this one, for less money and wifi.  This was kind of what we wanted anyway after reading about the horrible battery lives of most baby monitor screens.  We liked the idea of being able to just use our cell phones, laptop, ipad etc, to view what's going on.  It's been better than we'd even hoped.  Viewing through the Hubble app on our ipad, I think we could probably get at least 6 or 7 hours of view time.  We usually just have it on if we're sitting down to watch a movie or something, we'll prop it up on the coffee table.  We also have an old cell phone that I think we'll use as a full time monitor since the wifi still works fine on it.  The app also works great on our laptops, just open the camera in a browser tab with the volume up and go about your business, you'll hear any noises come through the tab, even if it's not the one you're looking at.  It's pretty great.  As someone else mentioned, there is about a 2 second delay, so sometimes we'll hear a cry from the bedroom about a second or two before we hear it on our device, but that's not a big deal.  The daytime picture is great and the night vision is acceptable.  It does have remote pan in all 4 directions, though sometimes this doesn't work properly.  Not a big deal for us either since where we have it pointed, we can see the entire sleeping area, so there's no need to pan.  You can also play 6 different music tracks as well as talk through your phone and it will play through the camera, although it lags.The best feature about this for us is that I travel for work, and this allows me to view the camera image from my phone, wherever I am.  Even away from a wifi signal, just through my data.  I don't even have to be on wifi, I just open the app and I can see my baby sleeping peacefully.  Or even my wife reading stories or playing with him on the bed.  It will eat up a lot of data if left running on your phone, so if I'm not on wifi, I just check in and close the app to avoid the data downloads.It has an added feature that you can pay for that will record things.  We don't have that, but the camera will send us notifications any time there's movement or sounds.  It keeps a log of still photos of each moment.  So I can open the app at work and see still photos from when he woke up, sat up, cried, etc.  That's pretty cool too.  I can see a little timeline of what's been happening, since I can't be there myself.We're so happy the model we wanted was out of stock and we found this little gem.Pros:No need for dedicated monitor with crappy battery life, just use any phone or tablet.Can be viewed over any device connected to home wifi network with proper app installed and signed into.  Also, once signed into that app, you can view the video stream from any device over wifi or cellular data signal.Good image and sound qualityCons:Pan may be not working properly, or perhaps we just have a weak wifi signal or something?  Sometimes it works, other times it doesn't.The music is kind of loud and ""clunky"", I don't think there's any volume control on it and it might be more alarming to a baby than soothing.There's a small blue light that flashes on the camera base, I'm not sure what's up with that, but in a dark room, it puts off quite a bit of light."
"2719","1","I bought this, not for a baby, but for my dad who recently had a stroke and can't walk (but doesn't know it) and frequently tries to ""escape"". It gives me the ease of being able to be in the kitchen cooking and see him trying to get up before he gets all the way up and falls. The reason I choose this particular model was it was the lowest priced one at Target that had WIFI / Smart phone capabilities. We don't have a lot of money right now considering the circumstances, but I needed something like this to be able to get anything done around the house whilst keeping him safe.The functionality and set up was very easy. Synced right away. The pan and tilt is a nice feature. There have however been two instances where I've had to use the reset button because after unplugging and moving the camera, it wouldn't reconnect with the base. Kind of annoying, but I can deal with that. The smart phone app is useless, however supposedly there is an update coming this week that will fix everything. Will update my review IF it does. But basically unless your on the same wifi connection as the system, it's about a 50/50 chance it will connect to the stream. Which is very frustrating for me when I want to check on him while he sleeps and I'm out shopping, etc. (someone is there with him, but I'm a control freak and need to see it myself).... And finally, the night vision. The night vision is some of the poorest qualify I've seen. I have several surveillance cameras, all that were cheaper than this and have far superior night vision. If you want the camera mounted far enough away from the subject to get a full view of their bed/crib, you will get nothing but a blurry mess. The night vision focus is only on a small area directly in the path of the camera. So I had to go and buy an infrared illuminator, and still don't get that great of quality at night. The sound quality is also horrific. Crying/Screaming might be the only thing you can hear. Rustling around is not detected. I have to have a 2nd baby monitor just for sound.Overall I'm pretty dissatisfied with this product, but don't have the time to return it... All thought I might find the time because for the $300 I spent on this, it should work perfect.UPDATE: The company responded to the review with some idea's to correct these issues. One was updating the firmware, which they left no clear instructions how to do nor does their website, I had to google this myself on the internet and eventually figured it out, but it was of no help. They also advised to shine a flashlight into the camera to activate the night vision, that did help a little, however i dont feel I should have to take this extra step every night to make the device function as it should.UPDATE AGAIN: I am officially over this product and getting rid of it. I have nothing but issues with the app, which I pay extra for mind you for increased functionality. The companies customer service is horrible. I will never buy another Motorola product of any category.The feature to schedule the times in which you want to be notified does not work. Half the time the app shuts notifications off all together ITSELF, half the time I get notifications even outside of scheduled times, and the other half the time when I get notifications I get 8-10 push notifications for the same event. At least 4 times in the last month alone I've had to complete disconnect, reset, and start from scratch as a new set up. This works for about a week and them I'm back to doing it again. I don't think I've ever more been more dissapointed in a product. I have a $70 camera that works 1000 times better."
"2720","1","Being a first time mom I wasn't sure what to look for in a baby monitor, and after using this system I wish I kept the box so I could return it! It was so expensive and it's garbage!The sound on this is HORRIBLE. I have the volume cranked all the way up and can only hear my baby crying if I put the device next to my ear. Even then it's faint. That's so ridiculous! Also a huge feature this thing is missing is motion detection. My sister in law has a baby monitor that goes into sleep mode and turns on when the baby moves. This monitor has 3 sleep mode settings that you cannot turn off if it's not connected to a power source. So if it's on 5min sleep mode it just turns off and if your baby is crying oh well.....!The video quality is decent, but I'm not going to just stare at a monitor looking for my baby to wake up, the point of sound is so that you can hear it if your not staring at the screen.If you hook it up to your phone the sound is obviously better because it's coming from your phone but then you are draining your battery and have to keep the app open... If I wanted to do that I would have bought a security camera with wifi.Total garbage and soo expensive. Do yourself a favor and really research and test out if u can before you buy/add to registry"
"2721","4","The device is great. We got it for our newborn so that we could watch her and listen to her while we weren't in her room (like what most people need in a baby monitor) This one was my favorite because the screen is very large, the quality isn't too bad (I think it's 480?) but it's not great. It's certainly not 720. I would say maybe 10 fps or less with the best network signal. It does have some nifty features like the very accurate thermometer which is on the outside (so it isn't skewed by the camera's internal heat) and plays 5 tunes of lullabies. It is also pan and tilt so you can pan and tilt where you'd like it to. Battery is very good on the handheld, and signal isn't bad either. the infrared works great and is bright enough to see what's going on. It also has a SD card slot for it to record video. I really like the wifi feature that lets me see what the camera is seeing. It's very neat. I have heard horror stories of people hacking the signal and watching the baby cam... well there isn't much to see besides a crying or a sleeping baby. They can hack into much better stuff lol.You can also shut the monitor off with a quick press of a button and just use it like a sound monitor which has the sound level lights as well.Overall, I would say this is a great camera and we're very happy.I took 1 star off because I wish it came with some way of mounting. you will have to improvise something yourself if you don't have a shelf to put this on. Also really wish the tilt went lower.If you are looking for a great baby cam, this is it!"
"2722","2","I love the idea of a monitor that can be used with a phone or a dedicated parent unit.  This seems to be the only one on the market, so I guess I'll do without because this is going back.Just put your baby down in a new location and need to plug in the camera?  BEEPWant to turn on the screen to check on your kiddo while your partner sleeps peacefully beside you? BEEPNot sure if you heard something, want to turn up the volume? BEEP BEEP BEEPHolding the parent unit with the screen locked, and touch where the buttons are?  BEEP"
"2723","4","The Motorola Dual Mode Baby Monitor is a decent baby monitor albeit at a high price. What sets this apart from other video baby monitors is that it comes with 2 cameras that can be used with the included screen (parent unit) and can also be viewed over wifi.  This is great for parents that want to watch over their kids while the babysitter or nanny is at home.  The cameras themselves have the ability to pan and tilt so they can be moved remotely to cover just about any sized room.  I have used this as a ""nanny cam"" as well as a security monitor to overlook my driveway and backyard to see when people come up to my house.  The video is clear and the ability to send notifications when motion is detected is very useful.to keep track of who is coming up while you are away.  The nightvision is about average, it definitely works but is not any better or worse than other video monitors that I have used in the past.  Also worth noting is that there are some delays in the audio and video but this is true with every video monitor.  Overall this is a great set although at a high price.*** Positive Points: ***- Can be viewed over wifi using the web portal- Parent unit can be used with the included battery pack or plugged in with the included adapter- Cameras can be moved (pan and tilt) remotely via the parent unit or via wifi- 2 way communication is possible via parent unit or via wifi (albeit with some audio delay)- Has the ability to send notification when movement is detected as well as take snapshots or video remotely- Video quality is very good over wifi, though the included parent unit has a screen with only average resolution*** Negative Points: ***- Price is high even for a dual camera setup- Parent unit has an average resolution display, the video is much better when viewed on a phone, tablet, or pc- There is some delay in the audio/video but this is true of all baby monitors/ webcams- Does not have a VOX (Voice activation) feature on parent unit so the video wont just turn on when the baby makes a sound."
"2724","2","This monitor was great for about two months - then the sound went off and I can no longer hear the baby (my granddaughter) crying and have to constantly watch the monitor to see if she is moving - not the purpose of the monitor!  P.S. My daughter bought the same one and has problems too! Hers doesn't hold a charge!  Shame on you Motorola for putting your name on shoddy equipment!"
"2725","1","Do NOT buy! I am writing this review at 3:30am because once again this baby monitor had woken up my infant in the middle of the night.1. The monitor beeps when it loses signal- which is EVERY night at least a few times a night. The monitor beeps on the parent unit AS WELL as on the camera so it is loud and wake my baby almost every time. There is not a way to turn down or off the loud beeping. The room is across the hall from us so it is ridiculous that it loses signal that often.2. The second camera that it came with never worked for more than a week. It kept losing signal and eventually over the first week just died. I called Motorola and they said that the pairing issue is something that they can not fix and the whole system must be replaced. They offered to do so - however I must send in the whole monitor system and then they send out a replacement- will take up to 2 weeks. Unfortunately I will have to buy another system because going 2 weeks without a monitor is unacceptable. That is why I have the monitor to begin with! It's what lets me know my baby is safe. It also lets me know when he has to eat in the night.3. The monitor lost it's picture twice now - the picture changed to a purple screen where you saw a picture within a picture and lines all throughout the monitor and eventually so pixelated you couldn't even make out any images at all. We got it fixed but was very inconvenient for about a week.  - the monitor played the sound wouldn't show anything in the room, only showed the Motorola logo screen. ***For both of these issues it required a system reset which means waking sleeping baby to move the crib to unplug the camera, multiple times. Because most of the time one reset wouldn't work.While Motorola's customer service was good, being without a camera for two weeks getting this one replaced is really annoying. Save your money and time. Buy something reliable. Oh and I've only had his camera for 3 months."
"2726","3","Bought this when my son was born 16 months ago but didn't actually start using it until he was a year old. So I've been using it successfully for four months. Camera is great, love that you can connect and see it from your phone anywhere. I don't like the fact that if it's plugged in there is no way to turn the screen off that I've found so it's very bright. I cover it with some fabric, no big deal. The big complaint I have is that after only a few months of use it is having trouble charging the screen part. You have to plug it in and wiggle the cord and get it in juuust the right position for the monitor to actually charge. If you bump it at all it stops charging and dies in the middle of the night just when you need it. Not the best for peace of mind. I contacted Motorola but they wouldn't help me at all since the one year warranty is up. For now I'm just wiggling the cord a lot and hoping I can get it to charge every time but I'll likely end up having to purchase an entirely new monitor as I highly doubt they sell just the screen part. So much for hubby insisting the most expensive monitor would be the best one."
"2727","1","Don't buy this piece of garbage! It had much better ratings when we bought it, but it doesn't even deserve the 3 star average rating it still has at this point. Unfortunately, we didn't start using it until our daughter was about 6 months old, when we moved her into her room. So, that meant it couldn't be returned to the physical store where we bought it, and it worked just barely well enough that I didn't go through the hassle of contacting customer service in time to get a replacement like I should have. When I did, today, they were horribly unhelpful--basically said it's broken and they don't have any suggestions, and then tried to tell me that the problems I was experiencing weren't common even though literally every other review now says basically the same thing. Here goes:1. From pretty much day 1 taking it out of the box, it was really inconsistent with recognizing the parent unit that it's supposed to come automatically paired to. You have to keep resetting it over and over again until it suddenly decides to work. It did eventually decide to work for several months, until we had a power outage and then had to go through the whole thing over again, and then it went back to randomly losing the connection left and right like it did when we first bought it.2. The camera is OK with bright sunlight, but the night vision picture is terrible. The camera has to be within a few feet from the crib to get even a blurry blob-like picture. I kind of got used to it until my mom was babysitting and said that she had no idea what she was looking at and thought it looked like an ultrasound--and she was totally right.3. Last night  (after maybe a year at most of actual use, but unfortunately more than a year since we bought it, so the warranty is null), it suddenly started beeping to alert us that the battery was dying--EVEN THOUGH I HAD IT PLUGGED IN. So, I thought maybe the cord is messed up and tried plugging several different USB cords in with no luck. It's completely dead. The ""customer service"" person today basically said, nope nothing that can be done other than buying a new one, and she'll helpfully give me a $15 discount.4. Given that the parent unit is shot, I decided to try to go through the hell that is re-pairing the camera to the app on my phone....AND THEN THE CONNECTOR ON THE CAMER ALSO BROKE OFF. So The camera doesn't plug in anymore either! I wanted to throw it out the window, but restrained myself and just threw it in the garbage instead, where it belongs. Thank you for the vent, hopefully it saves someone  $150 or so dollars. <U+0001F621><U+0001F621><U+0001F621>"
"2728","1","This monitor is a pile of crap. I paid $300 for this and there is not a night that goes by that I dont want to smash it to pieces. At least 5 times a night it ""loses connectivity"" that means it beeps REALLY loudly and wakes you up, and then it connects again in a few seconds.And then there is the beeping for ""temperature changes""  when there isnt an actual temperature change. this also happens several times a night for no reason and it beeps in the babys room. Yes the camera beeps in her room waking her up. This is the dumbest thing I can even think of and it happens nightly.Then there are the times where it totally disconnects and the only way to get it to work again is to go in to the babys room and unplug the camera and plug it back it, all the while it is beeping like crazy IN THE BABYS ROOM!I'll keep going here, the nail in the coffin for this pile of crap monitor is that while the battery was good at first not the battery lasts for about a half an hour if it is not plugged in.... Guess what it does when the battery is low? BEEPS every 2 seconds.I seriously will end up smashing this sleep depriving pile of sh@t before I am done with it. I cant think of another product that I have ever purchased that is this frustrating."
"2729","2","This is the fifth Motorola baby set I've owned... I also have the MBP36s series which I generally like (albeit quality control with the charging port on the parent monitor.)  That one is basically the same parent unit as this, but it has no wi-fi access.  I also have a Motorola Focus 85 that is wi-fi connected (has no parent unit).  I was hoping I could add that one to this parent unit but it didn't work in pairing.So how does this set compare? Well, if you are wanting a regular baby monitor... this set works great, just as good as my MBP36s series. I still worry about the quality of the charging port on the parent monitor... I've literally gone through 3 Motorola monitors and each one ends up breaking where you plug it into the cord.  I am holding my breath on this one, hoping...  thankfully they have a good replacement policy, but eventually be aware that you may have to buy a new set in about 2-3 years when the replacement warranties wear out. :(  Hopefully this one is better but I seriously doubt it, unless they finally learned their lesson after 3 models (yes, I've gone through that many models in 6 years!)If you are after this set for the wi-fi and Hubble capabilities (being able to see it on your phone or tablet no matter where you are at); I really would suggest getting the Focus 85... I've had that one for over a month and I LOVE it... it's MUCH more reliable than these; the ones in this set work; but they are definitely choppier and have a harder time connecting than the Focus.  I don't know why there is a difference, but there definitely is; I tried moving them in different spots, testing out the talkback, etc... and they just are a lot more intermittent and choppy.  Keep in mind that the Focus 85 one is also somewhat choppy and not perfect; but it's pretty decent; at least decent enough.  These on the other hand, really are not very good; I found just the video delay to be almost 45 seconds long between what is happening and what you are seeing on your phone. The FOCUS is only a few second delay.Really the only advantage to this set is that you get a regular baby monitor that works really good; and it also has a wi-fi capability that is pretty shoddy but at least it's there.  If you add the Hubble notifications to it (you can re-play the video from the notifications of movement) then it can work decently at least to know if someone is robbing your home. ;)  I'm not sure it's worth the extra money though... I was hoping they would be super good so I could just add two more baby monitors to my set... but since they are not reliable I am not going to get the two monitors and replace my ""once again failing charger"" on the parent monitor of my old set.  Also, you can't scan through the Hubble app or program on your computer; so you can only see one camera at a time.Other features:Music playback is pretty; not at all cheesy.  Some classical and lullaby focused ones.  The talkback works great through the parent unit (horrid through the WiFi app.)... this feature is great to tell the child to lay back down, or assure them they are just having a nightmare, etc... The scan feature is awesome... it scans through the available cameras and stays on each one a few seconds.  Great for multiple kid's rooms or playrooms, etc...  Movement of the camera from parent unit or from app through Wi-Fi works fine; you can move up, down, side to side, and it has a HUGE range of motion from left to right. Very nice.Overall I'm not really happy with this set; if you have nothing already it may be worth it to you to get a new set that has two wired cameras that work great and a little bit of wi-fi capability to keep an eye on things when you are outside the house.  If you are looking for either one or the other, I suggest looking elsewhere; especially since Motorola has some MAJOR quality control issues when it comes to long term (and they are EXPENSIVE... they should last 5 years!!!)  I have yet to have a baby monitor from Motorola that has lasted over a year old; so be aware of that."
"2730","5","If you have an elder in your family who is still living in their home alone, this is a wonderful product!  I have an elderly relative who is not ready to move into an assisted living facility yet, but who is beginning to have a bit of trouble getting around. She has daytime help, but is usually alone during the night. Although she has one of those call buttons to summon help if she should fall, the family still worries. So, my relative said we could set this product up so we could speak with her and provide help if she should become ill or confused during the night. Once this monitor was set up and the application downloaded--it was fairly easy, even for a non-techie like me--it works just beautifully. The screen is large and clear, and even in dim light (a night light is plugged into the corner of the room it monitors), everything shows up clearly and the sound is clear. Now that it has been installed for a couple of weeks, my relative says she's glad it's there. She likes being able to say good night and know that someone is watching over her.I can think of many more uses for this monitor, such as keeping an eye on babysitters, sick kids at home, etc.  I'm thinking about buying another one of these to set up in my own home."
"2731","1","I have had 2 of these units and both failed. Out of the box the sync with the base and unit worked fine. I placed camera in nursery.  Then all went wrong within 10 hours of having both units.Base/monitor sycn: most of the time the 2 lose a connection. The baby's room is next to ours.  Signal shows 4 bars and then lost connection with white monitor screen. Strange thing is the monitor would show that we could still turn the camera so it obviously was in range but the screen was blank.Hubble app sync: once the Hubble app was paired it worked better than the actual camera.  The streaming would be captured and archived and was easy to set up with the wifi in the house.  Never got far enough to test outside of the home. This part seems to be working but you need the camera to work properly to stream so it's a mute point.2 way intercom: it worked on one unit and not the next.  And it was extremely delayed. So my husband would hear me 4-5 seconds after I said anything. Then I would ask a question and wait and wait and wait.  We finally started to get the timing right. It is worse than the old in-home intercoms call boxes.  No one is coordinated enough to stand holding the monitor and watching someone face to then determine when to talk.  Awful!Monitor controls: seemed ok. But hard to get used to. Haven't been able to get them to respond sometimes and have to reboot.Zoom: 2x is poor quality.Music: only tried it once. Can't tell how loud or declared or clear the music is so never really used it.  On timer?Syncing base: final note - when the base lost connection the directions call to resync. While doing so in pair mode the camera would work but not in the fully sync mode.BOTTOM LINE:  this product has a ton of issues with both hardware and firmware.  The software is bad, user interface is lacking, wifi is horrible, regular Ghz connection is horrible, camera features could be improved. But this is a completely unreliable product and it's way over priced.The only good thing is the concept.  Would love a product where I can monitor from a far for my nanny.Do not purchase this product."
"2732","1","I never write reviews but for this product I had to! I<U+2019>m a first time mom spent quite a bit of time looking into monitors and chose this one thinking I would also be able to see it from my phone when I was out yes that function/ app didn<U+2019>t work AT ALL. the monitor sucks it is hard to use and will randomly <U+201C>disconnect<U+201D> and just beep really sound while my daughter is sleeping and I have to run in her room to re pair them.It<U+2019>s seriously the worst my husband wants me to throw it away and buy a good one but she<U+2019>s already 15 months and I don<U+2019>t want to spend the money again, my friend has the lollipop cam that seems to be a million times better.Oh the best part is my daughter broke the antenna the other day so if not child proof at all"
"2733","1","DO NOT BUY THIS MONITOR!!! We have had repeated problems with this product. The connection from the camera to the monitor fails constantly. The cameral switches off in the middle of the night for no reason. The app for the monitor never works; the camera is always listed as offline. Amazon only gives you a short time to return this product compared to others ... only makes me wonder if they know it's a less than stellar product.Customer Service from Motorola was initially OK until you find out there's no follow-through on the initial request. 5-7 business days for the new monitor to arrive, which on day 6 hadn't even been processed. Therefore meaning it could never arrive by day 7 - or close to it likely. I'm now awaiting a call back from a supervisor, but I'm not holding my breath.FAILED PRODUCT. FAILED CUSTOMER SERVICE. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!"
"2734","1","Terrible product! I want to monitor my baby at night while he sleeps. The ""night vision"" is laughable! We have a cheap non-wifi camera that does this much better on a tiny screen in black and white. On the Motorola half the time it's pitch black. If the room is lit it works fine, but my baby sleeps in a dark room so basically this expensive video monitor only functions to alert me if he starts crying. The iPhone app is archaic as well. Loading my video from outside of my wifi connection takes forever. Changing the camera angle takes even longer. You have to pay extra for recording video. The temperature monitor is useless as well because it reports about 10-15 degrees higher than the actual temperature in the room. if I could return this product I would do it in a heartbeat."
"2735","2","We received the MBP36S2 monitor as a Christmas present for our newly born daughter. It worked great - the video quality at night was wonderful, easy set up, good battery life until about 3 months of use. One night the sound just stopped working and I realized this waking up in a panic that I hadn't heard her all night. After 3 separate phone calls waiting over 30 minutes on hold I finally reached a customer service representative. They replaced it no problem with the MBP43. Similar - the cameras are a little bit larger and the design of the monitor was slightly different. The static on the monitor for the MBP43 was louder even at lower volumes. This worked fine again for about 3 months then the button that turned the camera to the left stopped working. Again motorola replaced it with the MBP43 (what they had in stock). Out of the box there was glue in the charger port and thus the monitor couldn't be charged. Replaced again with the MBP362 the charging port was loose and the monitor wouldn't charge unless set a certain way - needless to say I wasn't happy to be woken up in the middle of the night by the dying monitor that was supposedly plugged in. Entirely frustrated with all of these, I spoke with a supervisor who claimed no refund could be given unless taken back to the store (how am I supposed to do this if I don't even have the original monitor?). Needless to say - on our fifth replacement now we have been sent the MBP853 connect. The night vision quality on the monitor is TERRIBLE. However it was an easy set up and the hubble app seems to work so far. I will be replacing my own monitor with a different brand.Update 11/18/15: About 1 week into using the MBP853 I am having issues with the parent unit disconnecting from the cameras. Every time the screen times out or the video is turned off, the parent unit beeps signaling it has lost connection. It has also done this on its own randomly at 2 am. Really fun to wake up to and not be able to make it re-connect to the camera.Update 12/15/15: The replacement that was sent to me was the 854. Larger screen than the 853. The cameras are the same model number and thus the quality of the night vision is terrible (see picture). The issues with this unit, the parent unit the screen only stays off for about 1 hour and then it turns itself back on. I have not been able to find a way to turn the screen off in the middle of the night so it is only an audio monitor like the other models I have had. Also the buttons on the parent unit are touch buttons which are finicky and sometimes do not work. The other small thing is the touch buttons have a sound that cannot be turned off so if you need to adjust the monitor in the night, the buttons are loud. Lastly, the parent unit ""locks"" the keypad so there is no live feed when you turn the monitor on after a few minutes just the last screenshot before the keypad locks. You have to unlock the keypad to see the live feed. Last night after about 3 weeks of using this model the sound stopped working. I have tried re-pairing, re-starting, unplugging, etc and the sound does not work with either camera. Here goes another call to motorola..."
"2736","1","Do not buy this product. It will interfere with routers from major brands like Netgear. It will seem fully functional until your network goes down.The techs are aware of this problem.  They have no solutions.When this issue is brought up on their message boards, they reply and then close it for comment.  Buy from a different manufacturer.Update - things continue to get worse. The cameras randomly drop out in the middle of the night and the console starts sounding off like a foghorn while the camera beeps wildly. I had to crawl on my hands and knees into my child<U+2019>s room to reset the power cable to avoid waking my infant to make the monitor work.Young parents - avoid this product. Motorola knows it sucks, just like all of their ventures into cellular communication, and they will not be able to help you when very common issues occur."
"2737","2","My wife and I just had twin boys so we bought this unit, plus one additional camera.  After about a month, the monitor would freeze up multiple times a day and we found ourselves resetting it then having to pair each camera back up.  Finally, I put in a request to replace the monitor, which Amazon did no problem.  We received the replacement monitor and after two days of receiving it, it just didn't charge, nor did it turn on at all.  Thus, we are sending it all back and looking for another baby monitor product to purchase."
"2738","1","As a first time mom, I wanted the best of the best when it came to baby monitors and that's what I thought I had selected, but I was so wrong.  This monitor loses connection all the time and I've had to tiptoe into my baby's room in the middle of the night 3-4 times to reset the connection.  Being woken up by your baby is hard, being woken up repeatedly by your monitor?? Unacceptable.  One time I awoke rested and full of pride that my baby had slept thru the night, only to discover in horror that the video picture was frozen and that he wasn't sleeping peacefully as it seemed, he was wide awake!!  How long was he awake?!? Had he cried out for me?  Awful.  Lastly, I can't figure out why buy sometimes the camera unit in his room will start beeping.  What the hell?  Why is that even a function??  WORST EVER.  Please do not buy this."
"2739","4","I've recently bought one these after some research I did on internet reading reviews.The camera is quite good, the image is clear and the night vision is also quite hi-res and clear. I was expecting the camera has onboard battery and I only would need to recharge that, but it is not so. The camera has to be plugged to the outlet all the time. The pan & tilt of the camera is good, the envelope is good, but the tilting range could be better.One draw back though with the camera is on the bottom surface, there are just two holes to hang the camera on nails on the wall, but it would be very nice if there is another threaded hole for tripod attachment.The display quality of the monitor is quite good. The menus are not so good. The wireless range of the display is not that great. So don't expect to use the display from the other side of your home.However, the Hubble for Motorola app is quite good. I'm using the IOS version, so I can only speak for that. It works on wireless and 4G. I can easily run the app and get camera image on my phone from office. There are triggers in the app that enables warnings to be displayed on your phone when the camera captures sound or motion."
"2740","1","If I could give this less than 1 star I would! He first one we got hardly had any sound. They did replace it (since it was straight out of the box) but I had to ship that one back and they wouldn<U+2019>t send another one till they received my old one. Ok not great but not a big deal. So after using this unit for 2 years, the port in the camera broke off and the handheld units power button would sometimes work and often not work so i wasn<U+2019>t able to turn unit on or off depending on when the button decided not to work. Called Motorola again and told me since it was 2 years out of warranty, there was nothing they could do after they stated the problem was a faulty port and a faulty power button which they have been known to have these issues with many of these units. They did offer me to buy the exact same unit at a discount for $137 but it would only have a 90 day warranty. As you can purchase here from amazon for $150, why would I 1. Buy from Motorola when amazon offers better warranty, and 2. Why would I sink another $137 into a unit I know of probably going to give me another year?! Motorola has awful customer service and does not stand by their product. I get companies having a warranty but i also expect a monitor that originally cost $230 to last longer than 2 years. Absolutely ridiculous. Motorola has lost a customer over this. I will never purchase Motorola product again!"
"2741","5","This is my first baby monitor, so I have no prior experience with one or Motorola in particular. I had high hopes for this monitor, given the higher price point. We live in a 3 story house, I can be in the garage of the 2nd floor, and my reception works fine, never dropped before.. tt's 1800sq. ft. and I have not dropped service anywhere.During the first 2 night, the monitor was beeping, exactly like in the other reviews, in the middle of the night. When we took it out of the box, the update needed to be done, which we did. A day later, it was showing that another update needed to be done, however, unfortunately, the update was failing, no matter how many times we tried to update it. However, yesterday, I woke up, and the update completed itself, so that was nice. No more beeping.ONLY downside I found so far is the fact that in order to see more view in the camera, you have to put it further away from the baby (in our case) which means, the microphone is further as well, and you can<U+2019>t hear as good. Who puts a microphone on the BACK of the camera anyway??? This being said, I can hear everything, just not the baby breathing.Lastly, you cannot turn down the volume of the lullaby. ALSO, if you turn it on with your phone, you have to turn it off with your phone too, otherwise, it will start playing in the middle of the night. (Which was weird)<U+2026>Otherwise, the app works fine (you can<U+2019>t zoom in on the app), but the install was super easy out of the box, under 5 minutes. No droppings in service or wifi, no problem with sounds or delay, no problem with static, overall, a very dependable camera. I love the fact that I can keep an eye on the baby at work, THE SAME TIME as my husband at his work, and my mom at home with the actual parent monitor. I think this is well worth the moneys."
"2742","5","After charging this for the recommended time, we started using our monitor yesterday. Our house is long, with the sitting area at one end and the driveway and back door at the other end. We set the camera on a table aimed at the back door and driveway. When the driveway bell goes off, I can sit in the sitting room and see who is pulling in my drive. I love that! The camera can be wall mounted, too, but it must be plugged in. The night vision works well, although of course it is in black and white. Sound is good, it even provides the temperature of the room. Lots of great features, and very easy to use on my android devices or the portable monitor provided with the camera. One thing, we could not get this to work with our second generation iPad, so I'm assuming it's not compatible. Still not sure, but not an issue for us. This is a great monitor system, whether you have a baby or not. You can use it to monitor any area of your house or garage, etc."
"2743","3","I want this to work and be good..but more often than not, it is NOT good and it does NOT work. It's so frustrating. First of all, get this monitor if you want the blue light from the camera to wake up your child or keep them up. Because we all need MORE things to make sleeping harder for our babies... The power cord has an extremely heavy part of it and does NOT stay plugged in. It is also incredibly fussy and you have to position it exactly right to make it stay and plugged in. We do like the Hubble app, although it frequently cant find out camera. Clearly they have a lot of improvements since few other customers have success with this."
"2744","1","I thought it was great, but it didn't even last a year.  We bought this for our twins in April 2016.  Originally I had to exchange a camera because it was a lower quality than the other camera that came with it.  I figured it was defective. After a couple months of use the power cord became loose to plug in. If it wasn't plugged in just right and pushed a certain direction (it wiggled) then it would quit charging and wake us up beeping low battery.  Fast forward a couple months later and it's completely dead.  I had already contacted the company by email a couple days ago about the cord and got  no response.It has some nice features, but not worth it at all for less than a year.It was one of the most expensive dual monitors out there. Very disappointed."
"2745","5","I absolutely love these shades i ordered one then my sister ordered another one for herself looks great (its oversized)"
"2746","4","Checking on a sleeping baby is nothing new but the way we do it has changed over the years. I have used remote short-range audio receivers to keep tabs on when my kids woke up or were active in their cribs, but that never told me if they were awake and just quietly entertaining themselves. This monitor is different and has full video with record and playback as well as two-way audio, music and more.This monitor pairs a small but reasonably capable video camera with a hand-held video monitor. Both are charged (or can be used directly) via USB and when both powered on the monitor searches for the video camera until it finds it. They work together over WiFi and the feed can be accessed from the Internet.The video camera is a small device about the size of a softball when including the base. However, it is more than just a video feed with a microphone in it. It has IR capability that is good enough to allow reading an analog clock on the wall 4' away in a nearly pitch-dark room. It also has a build-in speaker so instead of just sending sound to the monitor it can also air sound into the room. The speaker is nothing special but it<U+2019>s not terrible either. There<U+2019>s an integrated temperature circuit which seems to be accurate to within a degree and is useful for knowing when the room is too warm or too cold. Under the base there are a couple of mounting holes so that the camera can be secured to a hard surface.The real power of this monitor as a paired unit is not in the camera but in the screen. The monitor has a 4.3"" screen but is a little bigger than a GPS navigator of the same screen size due to the controls one either side of the screen. The screen resolution is ok, not great but not unacceptable either. The sound quality is not particularly good but it doesn<U+2019>t need to be as a baby monitor. The monitor controls the camera and allows for moving the eye left, right, up or down, and can pan and zoom too, just with the touch of one of the controls. It can send audio to the camera so it allows audio communication too, and it has a built-in selection of several music tracks that can be broadcast to the camera as well (though the sound quality is mediocre). It displays time, temperature, connectivity status and more. It also allows for recording and storing via MicroSD.All of this is great, but there are limitations on the monitor. There is a limited range so that the screen will lose the camera with sufficient obstacles or distance between the two. Motorola does offer a free app for Android or iOS that allows connecting to the camera via mobile device like a phone or tablet across the Internet. However, this application requires an account setup with Motorola through the application. I am not so sure I like the idea of feeding video through a third-party that has control over my ability to view or interact with my camera. It does not help that I have a Windows phone as my primary phone and there is no support for this application on the Windows phone platform.For now, I use this monitor as a matched pair and it meets my needs.This is a very nice monitor and it far and away more capable than the old audio-only monitors. It allows two-way interaction and it has a video feed with recording. It can be monitored and viewed over the Internet but I have some reservations about doing so based on the configuration of the software used for this purpose. If you need a good baby monitor that tells you exactly what<U+2019>s going on in the baby<U+2019>s room and you want the ability to interact via audio, this monitor is expensive but worth its asking price."
"2747","1","Wow. Can't say enough about how much I hate this monitor. It was $300 poorly spent. I researched monitors while I was pregnant, registered for this one because it sounded top of the line and received it as a shower gift. Where to begin: the device was never able to connect to wifi so of course the phone app has never worked, too good to be true. The monitor NEVER turns on or off without fighting with and holding down the button 6 or 7 times so hard your finger is sore, this is usually when I really want to smash it with a hammer, and it to top it off, it won't hold a charge so it has to remain plugged in to turn on. Whopideedoo the camera moves up, down, left, right, only thing that works as advertised, that is IF you can get HAL the monitor to even let you in to the controls (""I'm sorry, I can't let you see your baby Dave."") I can't say enough about how worthless this monitor is. I want to smash it every day but I don't want to waste more money on a new monitor. Moral: Don't by this horrible droid."
"2748","1","As a new parent, you want nothing more than safety and security, for your baby. <U+00A0>When we bought this monitor, <U+00A0>we thought this would help give us peace of mind. <U+00A0>With the added benefit of mobile access, we were sold. <U+00A0>Well, now that our baby is here and it's past the 30 day return policy at Babies R Us, we are at the point of seriously regretting this pricy purchase!! <U+00A0>The monitor's sensitivity only seems to be loud enough if the poor child is finally screaming. <U+00A0>Well, the app allows you to zoom in way more than the monitor and the sound quality is also way better. <U+00A0>This would be great, if the app worked!! <U+00A0>It hasn't been working for some time now either. <U+00A0>I think everyone understands a little downtime, <U+00A0>but days on end? <U+00A0>Also, the monitor itself was also experiencing issues, at this same time, so we could not monitor our baby from another room. <U+00A0>At least mine was having issues. <U+00A0>But besides all that, the device you actually purchase should have just as great of sound and zoom quality, as a free app, especially considering you pay hundreds of dollars for it.Take a minute and look at the app reviews.  The app is Hubble.I know the app isn't the monitor, but if you don't need the app, you can always buy a cheaper monitor, that works better."
"2749","5","Though no fault of the manufacturer, I've run into a snag with signal. I'm building a shipping container home and am discovering that signal quality (wi-fi connection) is greatly diminished due to all the metal compartments.I am giving the product five stars based on the quality of the product design and functioning *outside* my structure. There are no problems when I try to use this outside, but with a new baby, we don't have many opportunities yet for outside-the-home activities with him.I bought a<U+00A0>Monster Digital SDUSA-0008-A 8GB Micro SDHC Class 10 Safari Series Memory Card<U+00A0>to use, but haven't installed them yet. I'll update this post after I've figured out if they work. I'm also going to buy a new router; I'm currently using a<U+00A0>TP-LINK Archer C9 AC1900 Dual Band Wireless AC Gigabit Router, 2.4GHz 600Mbps+5Ghz 1300Mbps, 1 USB 2.0 Port & 1 USB 3.0 Port, IPv6, Guest Network<U+00A0>and maybe the difficulties I've experienced rest with the router."
"2750","1","Absolute garbage! I couldn<U+2019>t get the monitors to connect took forever and then the quality was so poor on my phone all grainy and patchy to watch. With huge delays. Then the parent unit sound went out after 3 months of use. So I<U+2019>ve gone back to just the good old fashion audio monitor and still tried to use the visual but now that too isn<U+2019>t working. What a total waste of money. Over $200 spent for 2 cameras and a parent unit all of which are junk. I couldn<U+2019>t even give these away they are such crap! And I tried to contact customer service to get a new parent unit 4 months ago and never received any correspondence back. Shocking... I was still under warranty. I will never buy from Motorola ever again."
"2751","1","Read any of the horrible reviews on here, and you'll see why you should not get this camera. I'm on replacement number 6, and it's one defect after another. I don't know how they are even selling it..It's horrendous to say the least.One time the camera won't let you log in, another the monitor resets on its own, another the picture freezes multiple times a day, do you don't know if the image you're looking at is current or old, and now the picture is horrible. It's supposed to be HD with infared, but my 2 year old smartphone has better picture than that thing. Whatever you do, don't come here for a camera for your child. And as other users, while it is defective, I'm outside my warranty replacement range, so they won't send me a replacement, but all they've been doing all along is sending me one defect after another.Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. For the safety of your child."
"2752","5","I'm surprised by the bad reviews. Because even tho I can't review the access on a phone or tablet because I haven't tried that. The camera-screen works great.We are even upstairs and the signal is good. We even go to the garage! And I can still see and hear my baby. The fact that you can rotate the camera is a must. Keeping it in the right location is key. The microphone feature is good to use when I just want to talk to her before I go inside the room. It's pretty fun actually.The thermometer is usually 1-2 degrees off but that's no biggie. Yes,  a couple of times it needed to be turned off and on again. But that's it. I really do like it. And would definitely recomend it."
"2753","2","I can't speak for other monitors on the market. But this one just barely gets the job done. I have a few gripes about this thing, as follows:- This thing all but shuts down my home's Wi-Fi. The thing operates on the 2.4GHz spectrum and even with a dual-band router and the latest/greatest gizmos, the Wi-Fi speeds are still murdered. With the baby monitor on, Netflix/whatever stops streaming. Turn off the baby monitor and suddenly it's fine and zippy again.- Every time you turn on the monitor part, you get the last ~1 second of what was playing the last time the thing was on. So if you turned it off when your kid was screaming, you get about 1 second of screaming baby even though it was like 4 hours ago. Very jarring.- Used to be able to hit the button second-from-bottom to turn the screen off but keep the audio flowing. Now when I do that, it does the loud error beep thing. Have to sleep now with the screen covered.- Short battery life for the monitor. I get maybe 3 hours max before it starts loudly beeping about it.- Power cable connection to the camera is flimsy"
"2754","1","To put it simply, this monitor just doesn't work. I was very hesitant to get this monitor after reading the reviews, but I went ahead and purchased it. I've had it less than a week and I've had almost all of the issues with it that the previous reviewers had.1. The noise indicator lights do not work. When my baby is crying, the light is still always on the lowest green light. I tested it out and had to scream into the camera to make the lights go to red on the parent unit. The audio works, but the noise indicator lights do not.2. There is about a 3-4 second delay on audio and video.3. The time on the camera continuously changes. I've reset it about 3 times and within several hours the time will be completely wrong.4. The LCD screen on the parent unit will randomly turn on - as in in the middle of the night. So the brightness from the screen will wake me up and when I try to hit ""OK"" to unlock the screen, then turn off the display, it locks up on me. It's like the whole system freezes and I have to turn it off and on to get it to work again. This is a HUGE pain because without the monitor working, it's completely pointless.Overall if the monitor functioned like it's supposed to, it would make an excellent baby monitor with all of it's capabilities and features. But it simply just doesn't work. I'm not sure how this product even made it through testing with Motorola and onto the market. I do plan on calling Motorola to report the issues and see if there are any fixes in the works or possibly an updated model without all of the issues. I will update my review if any good news comes out of it."
"2755","1","This monitor is horrible!  I switched to this one from a Summer monitor bc I wanted one with wifi capabilities.  Even with strong internet connection, the stream is constantly freezing and the night vision is a joke!!  I can barely even tell there's a baby in the crib!  See images- the first one is from our old monitor and the other (the one you barely see anything on) is a screenshot from the Motorola).  Do not buy."
"2756","1","If I could give this item 0 stars i would!Never again will I purchase a Motorola product. We purchased a baby monitor for my sons room on 11/24. The Hubble app barely works. Within the first month the charger for the parent unit broke. We contacted Motorola via email, included a description of the issue, and photographs of the unit, receipt from purchase, serial number and model number. We didn<U+2019>t hear back from them for almost a week. Their reply was a list of questions that were already answered in my original email. They also again asked for the receipt model and serial numbers which I had provided them in my original email. I responded with this information again. Two weeks have gone by ... no answers.  Since then my unit has stopped charging completely and we are without a monitor. I tried contacting them through Facebook messager to get a phone number since this is not provided anywhere on their emails or website. They responded with the number however when your call is answered it asks for a case number. When I entered the case number provided via email (as recorded message states) it says it is not found and I am disconnected.This is absolutely unacceptable. I trusted this company to assist me in monitoring my child<U+2019>s safety and health and they have done nothing but fail me.  Never again will I make this mistake. Returning this unit and going back to the Samsung model we used from the start!"
"2757","1","We did not have good experience with this monitor, primarily with the video feature on the parent unit.  Sometimes it would work fine, other times the screen would be showing a picture that was no longer current.  For example, it has shown the baby in her crib, when we had already gotten her out of the crib several minutes earlier.  It's like it get's frozen sometimes.  Or sometimes the screen on the parent unit is on, but it would not display any picture.  It was just a fuzzy screen.  Note that we were always within a normal range of the camera, so if it's a range issue, then this model does not have nearly enough range.  We called Motorola after experiencing issues with the first one, and they sent us another one that still has issues.Although we haven't noticed any problems with the audio, the unreliable video makes me question the reliability of the audio as well.  Unreliable video and poor video quality on the parent unit is enough to make us regret buying this monitor."
"2758","1","We were initially very excited to get this monitor based on the numerous high-tech features but after a year of use we are very disappointed and can definitively recommend to everyone to NOT BUY THIS MONITOR.  Several major issues with this monitor.1.  The music function, while advertised as a way to play soothing music for your infant, is excessively loud and abrasive and there is no way to adjust the volume of this function.  It will not soothe your baby, it will terrify your baby.2.  If you turn off the screen but leave the camera on, when you turn the screen back on you have to go through a whole process of turning off the camera to reconnect to your screen.  It's a process that takes several minutes and while initially a minor inconvenience, after several months it gets old.3.  The range of the screen is ok at best.  For such an expensive monitor I was not impressed.4.  The online app for your phone (Hubble) requires either wifi or full 4G cell reception to work.  If you have anything less than perfect reception on your phone, you won't be able to connect to the monitor.5.  The final straw was that after approximately 11 months of use, the screen will not charge and no longer works.  This happened completely out of the blue.  No damage to the screen occurred, it simply just stopped working one day.  We called Motorola for customer service and their response was essentially ""the warranty is over, you have to buy a new one.""For a monitor that (at the time) cost close to $300, this purchase has been a huge disappointment for us.  Definitely not worth the money.  For the money we would expect we could get at least 1-2 years of use out of it but it appears that Motorola's business model is to build an inferior product so you have to keep buying a new one every year.  Motorola customer service is terrible.If you enjoy throwing a lot of money at a mediocre product, then this monitor is for you!  If not, get something else."
"2759","5","This is a full-featured baby monitor that does almost everything other than changing diapers. It's easy to set up, easy to connect to the Wi-Fi and easy to use with the mobile app.The screen is nice and large and you can easily tilt, pan, zoom  the camera from the controls on the main unit. While it's nice to be able to check on the baby remotely via the phone, I prefer to have a babysitter that I can trust rather than paying somebody and continuously checking online. It's nice to have the capability should you require it but I don't think I'll really use that feature.The price is higher than a lot of other monitors these days but you do get a lot of features for your money. If you don't need the Wi-Fi enabled remote montioring, you can get something without for less."
"2760","1","I am giving this one star because there isn't a lower option. This monitor is AWFUL. I am not one to leave negative reviews unless a product is truly terrible, and this one definitely is.I purchase this monitor locally, and ordered a second camera through Amazon. The monitor was purchased to replace an older non-wifi Motorola monitor that died after nearly two years of use. Our last monitor had a poor viewing angle, the button marking wore off almost immediately, and the picture wasn't crisp... but it was spades better than this.The first MBP854 (yes, I said first) had very low volume, the power cord would literally just fall out of it, the touch buttons didn't register when you hit them half the time, and the light for the touch buttons didn't work... so at night you had to blindly hit the general area where you thought a button was until you found what you were looking for. We obviously decided it was defective and exchanged it for a second unit.The second unit actually had lights that worked on the buttons, which was an improvement. And the power cord didn't fall out, a major plus. The volume was still incredibly low though. Even at full volume I could hear the baby louder without the monitor, and considering the monitor has about a 1-2 second delay it meant I always heard her first and then sometimes didn't even hear anything come over the monitor.The buttons were equally unresponsive on the second unit, and there were new defects in the mix. The clock on the unit didn't keep time properly, images would freeze on the screen, or partial images from the on screen messages would stick, and the screen would randomly come on for no reason (and stay on even when it was just on battery and should have gone to sleep). The images sticking on screen was pretty awful... sometimes I would still see an image of the baby asleep in bed when I knew my husband was changing her diaper!The ONLY thing I liked about this product was the ability to spy on the baby while I was at work via the internet and phone apps... but even those were poorly designed and very laggy."
"2761","5","After reading the negative reviews I was hesitant on purchasing this camera. I then looked at other monitors and there reviews were pretty much the same. So I decided to buy this model and I'm glad I did. I've encountered none of the problems listed in the reviews. I'm wondering if these people have poor WIFI, don't know how to adjust settings, or just a weak cell signal. The Hubble app for my Iphone 5 works great (WIFI or if I'm connected through Sprint), I don't get constant reminders like others have posted and the picture is fine. Is it 720P? No, but compared to other monitors it's pretty good. The only problem I came across was accessing the video from my work computer but that might be my firewall blocking this type of media.Hope this helps."
"2762","1","After my experience with this monitor, there is one reason that I would not recommend the product itself, and a second reason I wouldn't recommend any Motorola product.The product began malfunctioning within 1 month. In the beginning it wasn't bad, for instance the sound wouldn't work and you'd have to unplug and plug the camera back in for it to reset and send audio. Very annoying, but manageable. Then the monitor continued to deteriorate and after 4 months of use, we are now at a place where the monitor won't hold a charge and has to be plugged in continuously. It cuts out continuously - this morning we woke up to a blank screen and who knows how long it's been out. The audio is also still an issue. Because the product simply doesn't do it's job, I do not recommend purchasing.Now, why I recommend avoiding Motorola. I called the company to get a replacement for the defective monitor and they'll only give it to me if I pay for shipping. But it's not even all the shipping, they're just forcing me to pay to ship either the old unit back to them, or ship the new unit to me. So it's like the Motorola Execs got together and were like ""Ok, we sold them a completely broken unit, but isn't it also their fault they bought it?""Update:Received replacement unit and it too is broken. Obviously. I called company back to ask for a refund and the Cust Service Supervisor said, ""we can put a refund request through, but honestly it's not going to get approved.. that's the best I can do for you."""
"2763","3","We have only used this a few times as of hey but I have found a lot of issues.  The app works great with your phone and it's easy to use.  As far as watching from my phone is live it provided it stays connected.  If you have to use the monitor though, you will likely have issues.The volume is worthless this monitor is so quiet I  can hear my actual baby crying from the other room before I can hear anything from the monitor. This isn't an issue with the camera but with the monitor itself as I don't have this issue when using my phone.  The buttons on the monitor are all at once too sensitive and hard to push. When I'm trying to push them they don't work but if I'm busy trying to move the screen it's turning off and on, making tons of noise and switching between camera one and two. Which, because when trying to push the buttons on purpose is very hard,  is extremely hard top remedy.The camera itself is great and I love the night vision. The app works great. The monitor is complete junk for the price you pay for this."
"2764","1","This is the WORST MONITOR EVER!!!!! We bought our first one and thought we just got unlucky and got a bad one. There were soo many things that went wrong. Sometimes the touch screen wouldn't work. Sometimes you couldn't even turn the thing off without resetting it. On several occasions it would wake us up in the middle of the night with an annoying loud beep because for some unknown reason the camera would just quit working. We called and had another one sent to us, but it does the SAME THINGS!! Currently it isn't working at all. We have tried resetting it, unplugging and re-plugging the camera. It just continues to search for a signal. We've only had the new one 2 months or so. WHAT THE HECK!! DO NOT BUY THIS MONITOR!!!"
"2765","2","I didn't buy this through Amazon. But my monitor has now reached the end of it's life after 18 months of use and so I'll share what it was like.At the beginning it was great! Did everything just as advertised, and when I was gone but someone else was home with the baby I could still check on them too using the app. This was my biggest reason for this product- since most monitors use either base screen or phone apps. I liked that this one had both options.After a few weeks the buttons started to not always work. This was frustrating because I couldn't always pan the view or use the talk-back or the other features. But it still did it's fundamental job so I didn't call to complain.Month 6 every once in a while it would disconnect from the camera in the middle of the night and I'd have to sneak into baby's room to unplug and replug the camera.Month 13 it disconnected from the camera entirely and I couldn't get it back on no matter how many times I replugged or reset. Conveniently right after the 1 year warranty ran out. I tried Motorola Customer Support and the guy was very helpful and walked me through a few last-ditch fixes. It finally worked to set the first camera up as a ""second camera"". The monitor continued giving me the same earlier issues, but at least now it was generally working.Month 16 the charger for the base came apart and so I bought a new one.It is now Month 18 and the base no longer charges at all. I tried a new charger but still no luck.. Motorola pretty much told me I was SOL, they don't sell replacement bases. I've been using the app this past week which is fine, but my phone is not reliable to keep the app open all night. The other morning I woke up and the app had closed during the night so I have no idea if baby ever needed me. Shopping for new monitor now and it will not be Motorola."
"2766","1","We've had this monitor just over a year and at first the picture started to fade.  I decided to live with it and try to make do.  The sound then began to fade and the picture freezes or glitches out.  We paid almost $300 for this camera at the time.  I contacted Motorola and the response was that since it was just past the warranty,  they could upgrade me to the next model for $135. They said it was the only option for me since it was out of warranty.  This floored me as a company as huge as Motorola,  you'd figure they have better customer service.  I'm pregnant with my second child and was going to purchase two additional cameras for my house but with the terrible customer service and lack of responsibility to the safety of the children,  I'll pass.  I had actually read reviews about how wonderful the customer service was but those reviews were mainly from 2014-2015. I'm so disappointed that a $300 product that I trusted to keep my most valuable little man safe,  turned out to not last a full year."
"2767","3","I did not purchase the monitor on amazon.Ill start by saying it is very easy and simple to unbox, connect, wifi connect.PROS- Camera quality very good and so is night vision, hubble app simple and it works, range is good works outside my house from far corner at full bars.CONS- Cannot use a camera mount, and it DOES have to be mounted in a any sort of way to see baby in crib due to camera not tilting down far enough so u cant simply put it in a shelf on top of baby has to be lower (about same height as crib). I suggest directly or somewhat above crib.Last and most important, if you are buying a monitor to hear your baby look for another, unless your house is very silent you wont hear your baby unless hes crying and screaming really loud. From your phone is louder BUT if minimize app it puts Hubble app on hold (turns off sound). Hope this helps.I still use mine, but i dont recommend it."
"2768","1","I didn't buy from this site, but I felt compelled to leave a review here because I hope other parents will NOT buy this. We are on our 2nd monitor. The first one the sound went out completely and permanently, we were informed by Motorola this is a common problem. I'm thankful this happened during the day and not at night, since I wouldn't of heard my son (who was a few months at the time) crying at night. Definitely not safe, and I'm not sure why they continue to sell this product knowing this is an issue. We returned it and got a second one- this one the screen freezes frequently so it is hard to use the menu/buttons, it disconnects ALL the time where the camera/sound will not work, and it takes multiple resets to get it going again. I literally have a back up sound monitor in my son's room now for when this disconnects in the middle of the night. If I try to view the camera from my phone it usually does not work at all, and when it does it sometimes disconnects the monitor at home. Huge waste of money."
"2769","4","Not perfect but better than Vtech.Any one star reviews haven't tried other baby monitors!!! This one is far better despite its flaws.Sound  quality is great. Video- not bad.The ""music"" it can play is awful - just don't use it.It is reliable though which is what is important. The second it doesn't work it makes the most annoying beeping noise. Originally, I thought it was horrible until I tried anothe baby monitor that shuts off or doesn't alert you like this one does. Better to be annoying and loud than randomly not work or shut off.I would take that advice. With the annoying beeping comes security."
"2770","4","We have been using this monitor since our baby was born, has been working for over 18 months. I am not sure why all the reviews are so terrible. Wont burn your house down, wont hurt your baby, nobody is going to hack your router unless you don't have it password protected. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the baby damaged the charging cable, sometimes the camera gets disconnected but that was when we first got the camera and it was probably new and since then I am sure it has gone through software updates. The camera is always on so, of course its going to have problems. Every blue moon it needs a restart. It's pretty reliable and has been dropped a few times and still running strong. The software is great and can be viewed remotely which is nice. I would recommend it!"
"2771","2","I have almost had this monitor for 2 years. There has almost always been something weird going on with it. First, the cables malfunctioned, so we replaced them with regular micro usb cords. Then, it started randomly losing signal and scaring the crap out of me at night with it<U+2019>s loud beeping. Usually this is resolved by resetting the camera with the app. The picture has never been great. Recently, the handheld picture has become super grainy and useless. My only non-complaint about this monitor is the app... you can adjust settings, see baby from anywhere, and receive movement and sound notifications. BUT I will never buy another Motorola monitor."
"2772","1","Please save your money and do not purchase this monitor. We our on our second model of this monitor after the first malfunctioned with the screen dying after a few months of use.The battery dies quickly and does not stay charged very long, even with the screen being turned off while in use.I hate his monitor with a passion, but because we spent so much money on it,  I feel indebted to it.It has the loudest beep when it disconnects from the Wi-Fi and it constantly disconnects and drops service. It also shuts off on its own so you have to be sure to check it often.  Also, it will shut off as soon as it sees movement on the screen for my child. Then, it will act up and not turn back on. This loud disconnect beep happens day and night. I love being woken up by it beeping. My child finally sleeps through the night, but this monitor doesn't.I'm not one to talk bad about things, but I had to speak up to help others."
"2773","2","We bought this type of monitor so my husband can check in on the baby via his cell phone while he is at work. Good picture and we like the camera features but there are a few things we didn't care for:1. You really need to hit the power button ""head on"" otherwise it will not turn on or off. Not an issue, just have to get used to how finicky the button can be.2. The hubble app will occassionally show ""no connection"" and will drop the monitor view. We can be standing right next to the router and it still happens. Not a huge deal though as it doesn't happen all the time. However, when you have to rely solely on the phone app (see #3 below) it can be very frustrating.3. BIG PROBLEM... We purchased this monitor in December of 2017 but did not use it until after the baby was born which was the beginning of February 2018. Within one month, the cord failed to charge the handheld base. We found that the connection between the handheld and the power cord was extremely loose and so it wouldn't charge. I tried to get a replacement but it was too much trouble going back and forth with Amazon. They wanted me to return the whole unit but I just wanted a cord replacement. It was then on me to find the replacement cord. After 10 minutes I was already getting frustrated trying to figure out which cord was compatible. I gave up when someone suggested to use an Android USB cord. We have not had any issues with charging since using the phone charger. After only one month of use, the power cord should still be working. Very disappointing."
"2774","1","This camera is terrible.  First, it almost never connects to wifi, so I can't see it on my phone.  Second, even if there is picture & sound on the monitor, sometimes it thinks it is offline, and the camera beeps.  Let me repeat that.  The camera beeps.  The camera, in my baby's room, where she is sleeping.  I only know this because sometimes when I walk by her room it is doing it.  Like, why would the camera beep?  Is the baby supposed to relay the message that the camera is not connected to me?  I could see if the monitor beeped since that is actually with me.  Anyway, I had to have the first monitor replaced after 4 months because it stopped charging.  Now its been 18 months and the new monitor keeps losing signal.  In the middle of the night, at all hours.  And of course it beeps loudly in my ear since I keep the monitor on my night table.  The camera is probably about 10' from my night table, so I have no idea why it is disconnecting.  And finally, when the camera thinks it is not connected, it has a blinking red light on it, which just draws my 18 month old's attention to it.  The only way to fix the connection issues is to turn off the camera and turn it on again every time."
"2775","1","Bought through Babies R Us not amazon but figured more people will see this here. This was the first baby monitor I'd ever bought. I figured since we both have iPhones and iPads this would be better than buying a bunch of additional monitors. The LCD screen that is included with this is complete junk. The sound was so poor I would have to literally hold it to my ear to hear anything the speaker output. If I hadn't had the iPad then this would have been pretty much useless to hear anything. The cameras and monitor both use micro USB to power them. They both have a very heavy surge protector close to the end of the cord. That weights them down and eventually bent the micro USB so that no longer powered either the camera or monitor. I was using a spare USB I had to get either to work. I finally got fed up with this when the wifi connection started struggling to maintain the video. Returned this and found the loudest stand alone video monitoring system they had at the store. It was a summer infant wide view 2.0 for $90, like a third what I'd paid for this. Not sure who thought not making a speaker a priority for a baby monitor was a good idea."
"2776","1","This was one of our first exciting purchases we made nearly 2 years ago as we anticipated the arrival of our little one. We chose this exact model because we wanted to have wifi as a optional connection so I could use my phone or computer while I was at work to tune in to my sleeping child-- but we didn't want a wifi only device - we also wanted to be able to expand to another room if we were lucky enough for more kids, to add another camera. Here are the reasons this device gets a 1 star, ESPECIALLY since it was the rolls royce in price when we first got it.1) Random loud piercing beeps - yes, the reason we all use a baby monitor is so that while the baby is sleeping, you can quietly observe the baby. We still have no idea, nor can predict when this device will do it, but it has a high pitch screeching sound that will go off every 30 seconds until you unplug the monitor that is in the baby's room. If this happened once, it would have been too many times, but it's probably happened about 30 times since we've had the device...nearly once a month. Around the 5th time I wanted to throw the device into the garbage except the alternative is buying another new device. Now my wife and I just look at each other completely annoyed, especially because the beep causes our son to wake up during a nap or nighttime sleep time.2) Power cord to the camera instantly was touchy -- and now doesn't work. Think of if you bought a new phone, and your charger stopped working within the first 3-4 months...you'd be frustrated. Same with this device, I had to tape it down so when we dusted we never bumped it. Now, the cord just doesn't work. I've resorted to my cell phone charger as of today.3) WHY bright lights, or BLINKING bright lights? Why would any manufacturer ever makes a product that goes in a child's room with bright lights. The reason we know the bright lights are driving our son nuts, is because while watching the monitor, our son rather than sleeping, is staring at the camera when the room is pitch dark....why? because of the blinking or constant steady light (we've had both). I took black electrical tape and taped over it.4) The clock is slow, and slowly loses time. Not a deal breaker, just an annoying function. You'd think a company like Motorola could make a device that keeps time. One day you look down its 5 minutes slow. Another day its 20 minutes slow. We're not about 80 minutes slow and that's not too long since the last time I reset the time.In conclusion, the random loud high pitch baby waking beeps, bad cord, bad electronics, and bad overall product gets a 1 star."
"2777","1","The camera has some great features, none of which make up for it failing to do its singular task: monitor our baby. Initial setup was rather easy, I did have to disable smart network switch in Android, something that is undocumented and has probably tripped many people up, but once running the camera had to be power cycled daily. Thinking this may be the Hubble app and not the camera, I directly pulled an RTSP stream off the device using VNC in Linux, worked great when the Hubble app did and failed every time the Hubble app did. Reset the device and the feed comes back up, confirming the issue is the camera and not the app (it's certainly not the network). After about a month of daily resetting, the camera decided it was not going to connect any longer, subsequent attempts to add the camera back in to Hubble failed with the ""setup failed"" message reported by others.Support was rude, the woman I spoke with asked if I could see the camera in Hubble to which I replied ""no, I can see it when I put it in pairing mode and try to add it to the app, but it never succeeds in adding it to the app"". Her next suggestion was for me to update the firmware, to which I replied that I could not since I couldn't add the camera to the app. She responded in a condescending and accusational tone that I just told her I could see it (therefore I must be either stupid or a liar). Clearly she has never used the application and had no idea what I was describing when I mentioned seeing it in the ""add camera"" setup screen. I've been escalated to the ""Hubble"" group, who I am sure will blame my WAP and then process an RMA which I'm sure will take over a week. If we didn't have an AngelCare monitor we would have been unable to at least listen to our baby, this product is garbage and should not be purchased. Don't be fooled by the bells and whistles, a camera is only worth the money spent if it reliably transmits video and audio which this device does not."
"2778","1","Worst monitor ever. Wish I would<U+2019>ve researched it before registering for it and having a family member spend $250. I am on my second monitor, the first one had to be replaced due to camera issues and honestly the picture with this one isn<U+2019>t much better. I worked with customer service to get the first replaced and it literally took me almost three months to jump through all the hoops they needed me to. Now it will not hold a charge and the antenna has fallen off. Bottom line, my friend has a cheap one from Walmart (~$50) that has a better image. Lesson learned."
"2779","1","I bought this monitor back when it was full price. ""Its an investment in a quality monitor"" I told my husband. Apparently I was wrong. I woke up this morning, blissfully thinking that my twins had finally slept through the night. At least til I looked at the screen and saw them both screaming thier heads off, completely beside themselves. Who knows how long they'd been screaming. At some point in the night, the sound had gone out completely on the parent unit of the monitor. So the piece of equipment I bought to alert me as to when they woke up had failed in the most basic and necessary function. If the video had failed, fine, whatever, I can live without that long enough to get a replacement but what is the point of a monitor with no sound. So guess who will be sleeping on the floor of my twins nursery tonight since I won't be able to hear them cry from my room, Motorola's customer service is closed on Sundays, and the store I bought it at simple referred me back to motorola. Awesome... at this point I just want a refund to go get a different monitor since I'll sleep like garbage from now on thinking the monitor is going to fail again if I just replace it with the same one."
"2780","1","Do not buy this camera!  I am so disappointed by the performance of this baby monitor.  It continues to freeze randomly, has a long delay when attempting to move the camera and a times will not let you wake up the screen or adjust volume even when in the same room with camera.  This camera system gives me ZERO peace of mind!  I can't trust that I am actually viewing live footage of my baby as the sound will work but the picture is frozen unbeknownst to the viewer.  You think your baby has slept peacefully through the night only to realize at 4am that the baby monitor wasn't functioning properly for most of night.  Did the baby wake up?  Did the baby cry for an hour?  You don't know!  I expected much better quality from an established company such as Motorola.  As a side note, the design is not user-friendly as you can only ""safely"" pick up the monitor by the antenna to avoid accidentally pushing the buttons that are located along both sides.  After spending $300 on this camera we now have to go out and buy something better.  What a huge waste of money!"
"2781","1","Worst camera ever. Bluetooth capability is comparable to worthless. Will cause frustration. Will cause you to wake your baby up. Will make you want to break it. Here's what you can expect: sitting in the bathroom, 10 feet away from your beautiful sleeping peaceful baby, monitor loses connection to camera. Distress sets in. You can't see your baby and you're freaking out. You try to restart the monitor but all it does is beep because it can't comprehend basic commands and do its 1 literal job and connect to the camera. So now you leave the bathroom frantically and make sure your baby is okay. Babies okay. You will now, very quietly restart the monitor and the camera several times before the camera realizes it's a camera and that it's supposed to be on. Your monitor, being the worthless piece of technology that it is, will turn on and display the tempature and even recognize the sounds in the room, but get this, no picture. You will now sit down and be full of anger, still trying not to awaken the little one. You'll proceed to restart the camera and monitor again several times. Finally, the monitor and camera sync up. You're relieved. You did it! Then the baby wakes up."
"2782","5","My wife and I have gone through a few different monitors with varying results, but this one has been the best by far. Extremely simple set-up -- pairing is easy, as is the mobile app installation. We had the cameras, monitor, and our iPhone apps up and running within 7-8 minutes of opening the box (including a thorough read of the instructions).When it comes to monitors, connectivity is key, and this one gets high marks (even over earlier Motorola models). Literally only 1-2 momentary lapses, as opposed to the frequent, multi-hour outages we've had with other models.The color screen is excellent, and we like the monitor's compact/non-bulky design. The touch buttons are a welcome improvement over the touch-screen buttons we've used elsewhere, which can be especially frustrating during bleary-eyed late-night/early-morning wake-ups.The sound really lets us adapt to different settings. If there's significant ambient noise in the baby's room, we can adjust the volume *just* low enough to block out the white noise and only hear baby sounds. Same goes for when we're sleeping -- somehow the monitor knows when a sound is worth amplifying. Passing car? No. Baby cough, yes.We haven't used the communication feature much, but the music feature was a nice surprise and an excellent touch. Love that we can ease the baby to sleep without being in the room.All in all, we're extremely happy with the purchase and recommend it heartily. Good luck!"
"2783","1","When it works, this monitor serves its purpose - video is quality enough to tell what your baby is doing, the audio relays everything from the white noise in his room to the slightest of sounds he makes, and the range from camera to monitor works anywhere we need it to within our house and yard. The remote access via wi-fi connection and the Hubble app is sluggish and glitchy but works well enough to allow you to check in remotely.BUTWe are on our second monitor/camera set after the audio completely quit working on the first set after 9 months of use (as other reviewers have noted). The warranty replacement process is not particularly parent-friendly - we waited almost 2 weeks for a replacement and had no audio in the meantime - and we had to pay shipping for the new set, all to replace something that cost $200 and was less than a year old. Just this week, a month into the replacement set, the monitor can no longer ""connect"" with the camera for video even though nothing changed in our setup from one day to the next. While showing that it is ""connecting"" to the camera and beeping incessantly, it is transmitting live audio, so the devices are in fact paired to one another. I tried all manner of troubleshooting and re-pairing per the manual, to no avail, so we are likely back to Motorola's less than stellar warranty customer service line.In terms of minor annoyances, the ""touch-screen"" buttons are slow to respond when you want them to, and hyper-sensitive when you're not trying to push them, as others have noted.Bottom line is that we are somewhat stuck with what we have, but I would absolutely not recommend this model to anyone (and I would be wary of any Motorola offerings given the level of customer service we have received)."
"2784","1","It started off at 4 stars, but quickly dropped from there.  The picture quality wasn't as great as it advertised, but it worked fine.  After about a month I would have to re-pair the the screen with the camera several times a week.  Then the sound stopped working.  The ""touch"" controls barely work, meaning you have to press them several times to get anything to happen.Each time you press a button the unit makes a noise, which you can't turn off.  So much for adjusting the camera while still in the babies room and being quite.  Turning the screen on and off is a gamble too.  Hold the power button in too long or too short, and nothing happens.  It seems to be a different amount each time.  Also, there is a hideously bright blue light on the camera base.All in all, I would never buy this thing again, especially for the amount that it cost."
"2785","3","Baby monitor worked well for while and then suddenly the camera stopped connecting to the monitor and our phones.  I would wake up in the middle of the night and the image was frozen, no connectivity.  I am pretty frustrated and disappointed with this product.  I am returning and ordering a different one."
"2786","1","I am extremely disappointed in this product. After spending this kind of money on this system and an extra camera I would expect a system that simply works. My first system one of the cameras kept jumping back and forth from color to IR at night, the monitor regularly lost time, lost connection in the middle of the night while beeping annoyingly, buttons would lock up and the screen would randomly turn on and stop scanning between cameras. Motorola authorized an exchange of the whole system and I just got the new one. So its been a little over 24 hours since I have set it up. I set it up in my office as I don't want to go through installing it at home until I am certain that it works. So as I stand right now the cameras seem to be functioning properly. The monitor itself is another case. The sound is barely audible from it, I am getting random disconnects and beeping from it, and as the first one it randomly stops scanning and the screen turns on. What I noticed too is that when this happens, even the camera that is shown on the monitor while showing a picture it is actually frozen, so there is nothing coming through the monitor at all. To make matters worse they are all in the same office.... not even in different rooms and this is happening. So now that I have already done one exchange I am not even sure what to do at this point!"
"2787","3","I too wish I'd more thoroughly read the reviews before purchasing.  Here's the thing: this unit ""wants"" to be good.  Out of box and setup was easy. The app is even decent (I didn't have the connectivity issues others have noted), and I do really like the ability to see into the baby's room remotely. Will be nice when I'm on the road.There are really just two problems, but unfortunately both are biggies: 1. The night vision is horrible. Not bad or poor; horrible. Basically blackness.  The firmware upgrade doesn't fix it either.  2. The volume pickup is low, as others have noted. What's interesting is this model's predecessor had great night vision and ultra-sensitive volume/microphone pickup; would have kept that one but the baby threw the monitor into the pool. Not sure where or why Motorola went wrong in the design of this one.By the way, the daylight view is great. Crisp and clear. If only the night vision worked, that's when you really need it."
"2788","1","This baby monitor is junk. From out of the box certain things didn<U+2019>t work right. The clock never keeps the correct time, the cameras are a hassle to connect to the monitor, and even more to connect to WiFi. We bought two cameras, and one of them worked about 4 months and could not find any WiFi signals. The charging port is loose, and we<U+2019>ve had to change power cords on it. Now the sound doesn<U+2019>t work. It is only a year old. Stay away from anything Motorola. Their products are poor quality garbage."
"2789","1","Garbage. even with the camera and handheld monitor within 60ft the would loose connection regularly, the app connectivity is good, when it works, it lost it's wifi permenantly after 8 months, then the camera itself died completely at 13 months. When it did work had to hard reset regularly and re-setup. total garbage.Positives? when it works the night vision is great, pan and tilt works fairly well."
"2790","2","This is not a good system. First, constant connection issues. The app that is supposed to work with your phone is terrible and will never connect to the camera. The camera also has a hard time finding the hand held monitor, it beeps very loud until you switch the camera off and start over. This isn't good when a baby is sleeping. Next the battery life is so short. I will change it to a full charge and it can't even make it throttle whole night. I thought the part that was so cool was the video monitor is portable, however if it keep dying what's the point. The picture is ok but nothing special, I guess it does the job, but if you done have it set at a perfect spot it's hard to see into the crib even with the moving camera function.  I would not recommend this to a friend and I'm even considering buying a different one and cutting my losses."
"2791","1","Horrible monitor! The monitor wakes us up more than the baby does. We have had it for less than 1 year. It won't charge anymore. You have to wiggle the cord to a certain angle to charge and then it only charges for a few hours until you have to start wiggling the cord again. Wifi is a joke. The camera is constantly saying it is offline. This is an unreliable product. I wish there was a way to get me money back. I will never buy a Motorola product again. I have been dealing with customer service for over a week now. Still no resolution. They are very slow to respond."
"2792","4","I have used this monitor everyday for 3 years and it has been a mostly a good experience. The wifi is great to check in the little one when we occasionally get a sitter or while I was in the hospital having my second baby. The sounds works great for me. Actually I keep it low because I can heard even people talking in a different room. Inflated is good too, quality image decrease with distance but that is expected.Only had a couple high temperature problems in a hot day that resolved themselves in a few minutes.Now I am trying to figure out if a second camera can be added for my newborn."
"2793","1","DO NOT BUY THIS. The last thing you need to worry about is your monitor working/ not working. ESPECIALLY if you are a first time parent. I thought I could trust the name, Motorola.. I forgot big name companies are overpriced & do not work. The moment we got it, it glitched. Always saying motion detected, when there wasn't even a baby in the crib. Now, the camera just doesn't work. I cannot see my baby on the app, it says ""camera offline"" & the monitor holds a frozen image, but I can hear them breathe- THANK GOD. Complete overpriced garbage.. Which was priced at $299 when it was bought for me in July 2015... We didn't take it out of the box until January 2016. This should not be an issue!! I'm throwing this out and ordering from a company that specializes in baby monitors, and doesn't rely on a ""big name"". I wish I could give less than one star! This is a baby we're talking about!!! A working monitor is a must while chores are done during naps!!!- livid mom"
"2794","1","TERRIBLE.  DO NOT BUY.  Slot for power cord failed in less than 4 months, and takes over a week to get a replacement sent (and they have to put it on your credit card until you ship the broken one back, a terrible customer service policy).  We have a terrific wireless router, but the video feed to a smartphone failed about every 30 seconds or more.  The ""Hubble"" software to view on a smartphone is a joke.  Loud camera movement wakes up the baby.  Clearly Motorola does not take infant safety seriously. The last Motorola product we will every purchase.  Ever.UPDATE:  3.5 weeks later and MOTOROLA NEVER SHIPPED THE REPLACEMENT.  Calling them today-- they said there was an error in the order.  When I pressed for details, the rep admitted there was no order (lie #1), then said it was out of stock.  I insisted on a shipment today and was told it wouldn't be shipped for 2-5 business days and that was the soonest it could be shipped.  When I asked if they ever sent anything through a next-day carrier, he said yes (catching the earlier lie #2).  So now I'm on the phone (over 30 minutes now) waiting for a supervisor, and was told none was available but that I would be called in the next 24 to 48 hours.  OK, so some of the worst customer service I've every experienced.  By the way-- a week ago our son had croup, and we had to sleep in his room for 4 nights, since we had NO working baby monitor.  Does this count as Motorola endangering the wellbeing of our child?"
"2795","4","First things first: As a basic baby monitor it works excellently.There was a time (I know it's hard to believe) when that was enough, but, then, there was a time when it was enough for your phone to ring and let you talk to other people, and they to you.AnyhowAs to the other bells and whistles (see product description), those I've tried (or been able to try) work just fineBUTBe advised that several of the features are available only to COMPATIBLE devices, and many people may have devices that are UNSo, if a particular bell and/or whistle IS a reason for wanting this device (it ain't cheap!), make sure your compatible BEFORE finding out you jest ain't"
"2796","2","We bought this... And then lost the receipt.  Sadly because it kinda sucks.  This is the third one we have had in four years.  The first one I dropped the monitor and broke, the second one disappeared into our 3 y/o's world and now here we are.  Our youngest daughter has cerebral palsy and needs round the clock monitoring and so the camera is a must, not to mention being able to hear her sounds in case she chokes in her sleep.  But I can't hear a damn thing out of this thing.  For real,  the speaker on the monitor barely makes a peep even when she cries and when it does it has a 2 second delay.So now,  the flashing blue light on the camera is so bright, and alternates between blue and red and is right above her crib and beside my bed.  So even though the monitor is off at night it keeps me awake, which we all know sucks.  So I put a piece of electrical tape (all i have) over the light,  which evidentally is also right beside the mic,  and so now we can hear NOTHING.  Very expensive monitor,  definitely not worth it.  Save your self the misery.Great video quality though.  Massive screen,  a little too big for busy moms.  Touch screen buttons are not ideal."
"2797","1","Horrible! We have had nothing but problems with this product. At first we were happy with the features, but quickly had one problem after another. First, the screen has frozen up on us multiple times. We only know this because our daughter would be in her swing, swinging back and forth, and then it would just stop.  But once we went upstairs to check on her, the swing was still moving. Second, the buttons on the device just randomly stop working. You can't tap anything, can't turn it off... nothing. Third, the device will beep at you over and over and over again saying ""Press OK to unlock"" even when nobody is touching the device at all. Fourth, the screen has gone completely out on us - just goes black.  Fifth, the microphone randomly gets stuck on. It is supposed to only work when you hold the microphone button on, but somehow turned on on its own and stayed that way. The baby ended up waking up due to all the noise coming through.Our main concern is the device malfunctioning during the night when we don't know. Say it is frozen, but we wake up in the middle of the night, see that the baby looks fine, and fall back asleep. If you are not in distance of hearing your child and are relying on the monitor, the baby could be crying and you would never know.There is a slip that comes with this product that tells you to ""Stop. Do not return this product to the store."" So we contacted Motorola to discuss the issues, have them send us a new one, and give them a chance to make it right.  I sent them a copy of my receipt. The only help they could offer was for us to mail our current one back and go without while you wait for the new one or charge us a $150 hold fee while they send us a new one in 6-11 days. I found this unacceptable given it was their faulty device. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was told no one was available and someone would call me back within 24-48 hours.  It is now nearing 48 hours and I have not heard from anyone.Overall, extremely poor performing product and horrible customer service from Motorola."
"2798","2","Works okay for us for two months so far. My issues are that; it blocks wifi signal to other devices so I have to choose between baby and sheer boredom, it beeps loudly when it can't find connection to camera -which sucks as baby sleeps in our room per AAP recommendations, but I can't get up and check on her on the other side of the room- and can wake baby (I get it, the screen already says that it can't connect, why are you beeping as well??), And the start up screen is blindingly white, which doesn't help when you're in the room, and the baby starts to fuss, so you click on the monitor and the bright white light throws your shadow on the wall like a freaking batsignal, and your kid sees and starts wailing.If Motorola fixed these issues next time, I would recommend this product. Just kill the beeping, change the start up screen to black with white lettering, and fix wifi. As is however, is a traitor to sleepy parents."
"2799","1","AWFUL!!! I am completely disappointed with this monitor. This very expensive monitor I might add. Loses signal ALL THE TIME. This results in an extremely loud beeping sound from not only the parent unit, but the camera itself. Sometimes this occurred at 3pm, sometimes at 3am! The only way to get the camera to stop beeping is to physically turn it off and back on. I've had this monitor for 9 months and it already stopped working. I thought it was the charging cord so I ordered another one...nope, still doesn't work. Calling Motorola today. Please do not buy this monitor. You will absolutely regret it."
"2800","4","I just called customer service to deal with the issue below and they sent a one time replacement as a courtesy replacement even though my product was past the 1 year warranty. I want to share that I had a good experience with them despite the negative experiences I have read about.I have had great luck with this monitor. The range is good; wee have about a 2,000 sq ft house and I have never had an issue. I can even be outside and it keeps its signal.The issue I have had is with the internal mechanism the charger plugs into for the cameras. It snapped off inside of the camera. The first one broke a few month after the warranty expired. The second one just broke today, about 5 months after it expired.We had to plug and unplug both cameras a lot, so my advice is try not to unplug the cameras a lot.The battery life on the parent unit has been good but the battery door won't stay completely closed because a piece snapped off. It was from a fall so our fault, but not very durable.Overall I recommend this monitor over the others I have used. Just treat it gently."
"2801","5","OK, I have to admit something. I don't have a baby in the house anymore. I do have a three-year old grandson living with us but currently he sleeps in his own bed in his Mom's room. So no, I'm not going to install this there. Plus when he's not in preschool he usually takes his naps on our bed and I have no intention of putting in that room. So I didn't get this to be a ""baby"" monitor although with all the extras included it would be a wonderful device for that.No, I needed a security cam for a blind section right by the front door. Although I have a cam that points out from the garage overlooking the driveway and street, the small front courtyard is not covered. I work from home so I can keep an eye out when we have UPS deliveries or those annoying realtors who come by and knock at  the most inconvenient times. I can also set it up when my grandson is playing in our small backyard to keep an eye on him.Most of the reviews here already cover all the great attributes this system has so I'm not going to go over them again. Instead I will say that it is a quality product that performs better than expected. While I initially thought the cost of the unit was high, being just under $300 as of this review, I have to say I came away very impressed with it's value. Highly recommended not just for a baby monitor but for many purposes where you might need an extra eye."
"2802","1","If I could give this zero stars I would.  This is absolutely the worst camera/monitor you'll ever buy, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  It worked great for the first month or two and then the sound on the hand held monitor stopped working.  We called Motorola and they sent us a new one a few weeks later.  That worked fine also first try and then not only did the sound go, but so did the picture.  And then the sound came but no picture. Called Motorola again... and the same thing happened. We're on our 4th camera/ monitor. It still does not work, no volume at all.  Our child is a little older now so we're chalking it up to bad luck but absolutely do not even begin to deal with the hassle if you don't have to.  There are much better ones out there that don't cost as much.  Our family purchased a cheapo and its a million times better than this very expensive (purchased at Babies R US) one."
"2803","1","We were gifted this camera and it is absolute crap. We have only used it for a month or so and the charger has already died, the parent unit doesn't take a charge sometimes and the battery life just sucks. The video is okay...when it works. I'm currently writing this review from the recliner in my daughters nursery because the video has decided to freeze and I'm left here looking for a new, reliable monitor. It was gifted so I'm lucky to have not wasted money personally on this but please heed my advice and just don't buy this unit!"
"2804","1","The infrared ""nightvision"" went out around the 3 month mark, coinciding right at the point where my child started rolling onto her stomach, which is a stressful time and the worst time that a new camera can fail. Now at night, we have no way to see her, its just a grainy pink screen.The ability to use with our cellphones worked briefly but somehow the camera dropped off our network and now can find it, but will not connect.Totally useless. Save your money."
"2805","1","I never leave reviews. Ever. I tried so hard to force myself to like this monitor. My dad wanted to buy us a monitor when I first had my son. I had to basically beg him to purchase this one because I wanted the capability to log in and view the camera from my phone. He read the reviews and was super hesitant, and tried to talk me out of it. He decided to buy it because it is what I wanted and I was persistent. This is one of those, ""I should have listened to my parents"" scenarios. THIS THING IS HORRIBLEEEEEEEE. I am on my second replacement camera and second replacement monitor and the monitor is already having problems. I would be on my second charger, but they are out of stock and ""don't know when they will be getting more"". I had to purchase one in a store. I hate this thing. I hate it so much, but I am too scared to tell my dad that he was right. Read the reviews!!!! Avoid this piece of junk!!!"
"2806","1","I bought this camera system and have had problems from the start.  At first the connectivity was very poor between the provided monitor and the cameras.  Sometimes they do not connect and if they do, the stream is very choppy.  Even when you are only 5 feet from the camera.  When it comes to the ""Hubble"" WiFi system, it is poor at best.  The pan, tilt, zoom option is EXTREMELY course.  When you want to move the camera one way or the other, it moves a full screen of distance.  There is very little support. In fact, I called Motorola for help and the representative that I spoke with was rude and helpless.  She blamed the problems on a broken camera.  So I returned the camera system and bought the same system, but this time with two cameras.  I experienced the same issues.  I purchased this system while my wife was pregnant and set it all up.  Now that my daughter is home and we are using the camera, we keep running into more problems with connectivity and the newest problem is with the monitor.  The monitor died after being fully charged and set at our nightstand while we were sleeping only to find that the monitor was dead when we woke up to her crying.  The bottom line for this system is if you plan on keeping the monitor plugged in at all times and don't plan on using the 'features', the camera is pretty good.  But when you consider the reasons for purchasing a system that keeps you on the up and up with your child, then this system is worthless.  We are very disappointed with this system and have found no support through Motorola and the 'Hubble' company that controls the app for the smart devices."
"2807","3","I haven't used the monitor all that much yet. Still waiting for the baby. He is taking his sweet time.Pros:Simple to setup. The monitor itself takes a second to pair to the camera.Very easy on your smartphone as well. Download the app and scan the bar code on the instructions and it linked.Picture quality is good, 720P.The lullabies are a nice feature.Cable length is very long.Cons:Once the monitor is linked it takes five minutes before you can use it. During this time, you cannot move the camera or change the settings.The camera is very slow to react to any control changes. Positioning the camera correctly is annoying.The wifi range is horrible and I don't believe you can even get an extender for it. So if you want smartphone monitoring keep it close to your router.The power cable has a large transformer? right near the end where you connect the camera. This was a very poor design, it should be where it's plugged in."
"2808","1","It's disgusting this monitor is $200+. I don't think it's worth even $50. Such a failure. It loses its connection & beeps in the middle of the night to ""re-sync."" It randomly loses the audio. The buttons are not lit nor textured, so you can't see or feel the correct button in the dark.  It also automatically locks the buttons, which is infuriating when you're half asleep. The lag time for the pan/tilt is unacceptable. The indicator light on the camera unit changes colors at random...blue, or flashing blue, or red....very distracting for your child.  The ""lullaby"" music plays from the camera unit, which then is picked up by its own microphone, so YOU get to hear the music at full volume, which also drowns out any noise from your child! And customer service is awful.My husband wanted this monitor because we could remotely check on our child with our smart phones (i.e. while at work or on a date). In the year we've owned it, we've done this ONCE. It's an interesting idea, but the reality is, you don't use that feature as often as you'd think. And its many, many flaws just discredit any good features.Motorola should be ashamed of this product. Please heed the warnings and RUN AWAY!!!"
"2809","1","I don't typically write reviews on products but my experience with this baby monitor has been horrible.  We have only been using it for 6 months and the video screen had stop working 3 months in.  It completely stopped charging we were able to contact Motorola and they sent us at first the camera portion.  That is not what we needed we stated it was the video screen monitor.  We then had to contact them again and they finally sent us the right part.  We were out a baby monitor for 2 weeks and having to stream through our phone.  Thank goodness that worked. Now 3 months after getting the replacement the same issue has happened again. Our video monitor will not charge and we have no monitor.I find this completely unacceptable out of a product that is to monitor the safety of my son while he sleeps and we spent a good amount of money to get what we thought was the top of the line baby monitoring system.Not to mention it feels and looks so cheaply constructed.  I would stay away from this product to avoid the headache and worry while you suddenly out a video monitor."
"2810","1","Horrible product with no reliability. You will reget if you buy. Don't get sold buy it's  features like i did. More features = more problems. After a year of constant connection issues the monitor and camera constantly beeps throughout the night waking up both my wife and I and baby because of the camera losing connection. You have to file a lengthy claim online before anyone will talk to you about your problem. Then the only thing they could offer is selling me another camera. It's not even motorola who handles there faulty junk. It's some other third party who you have to talk to. All they would offer me was a more expensive replacement then I originally bought. I usually follow consumer reports suggestions (this WAS NOT on their list) but liked the features the camera provided. Big mistake and never buying motorola agian."
"2811","1","Worst monitor ever! I have so many issues with this product, I don't even use it. I had so many problems with this thing, I thought it was defective. Spent hours on the phone with motorola and got them to send me a new one (since I figured I had a defective unit), but have all the same problems I had with the first one, so it wasn't defective, it's just a very, very poor product. It doesn't ever have power unless it's plugged in, the charging unit never stays in place so it's rarely charged, it beeps all the time in the middle of the night, the light comes on in the middle of the night waking us, the control touchscreen ""buttons"" rarely work well...We found out the ap on our phone is works much better, but pairing the unit took us literally months to get to work after countless calls to motorola."
"2812","1","I hate this monitor.  The connection is constantly getting lost.  The parent unit screen goes blank and starts beeping intermittently.  The parent unit often freezes and the buttons are inoperable.  The camera sucks...when it is dark in my child's room you can't see anything on the screen.  I was told by customer service to fix the problem by increasing the ambient light in the room...uh, I'm not turning on the light while my kid tries to sleep so the night vision on the monitor works.  We called to report these problems and we're sent a new unit, but the new unit has the same problems.  My poor baby screamed for who knows how long one night without me knowing because the stupid monitor froze up.  I've taken ton sleeping on the floor outside of my kids' rooms until we can afford to buy a new one and toss this overpriced piece of junk in the mail."
"2813","1","We registered for and received this monitor as a gift.  Our daughter is now 8 weeks and we have only really been using the monitor consistently for the past 5 weeks or so and have already encountered numerous problems.Let me start with some pros: To start, set up was easy-  I will give it that.  We have not yet had the chance to use  the Hubble app, so I can't comment on that. It is very sensitive to sound, so you can definitely hear every gurgle etc.  In fact, it was so sensitive that I turned the volume on the parent unit down because otherwise we could hear every peep the baby made and our baby is a loud sleeper. I like that it has the remote pan/tilt and the ability to minimize the video while the monitor is still on and just rely on the audio (when it works- see below)- I found that useful for the night because I didn't want a bright image shining at me from the nightstand.Now on to the problems we've had with the monitor- Pretty soon after setting it up, the parent unit would randomly beep and lose connection with the camera.  The camera and parent unit weren't out of range of one another- they would just randomly drop.  Then sometimes the parent unit would beep for no discernible reason.  This only happened occasionally, so we dealt with it.  Randomly, the video would be distorted: weird colors, weird static but this was resolved by turning on and off the camera itself.However, in the past few days, the monitor would lose audio and only show video.  This is a deal-breaker.  This happened in the middle of the night, which is when we really need the monitor to do its job.  In addition, the parent unit would not let me minimize the video and instead would beep loudly throughout the night.  We eventually gave up, and brought our daughter into our room because we did not trust the monitor to properly function. The lack of audio seemed to resolve by turning the camera on and off- but again, this is a deal-breaker because in the middle of the night, you wouldn't know you don't have audio until you could hear the baby from your room.  The audio seems to be working the past few days, but the parent unit will still randomly beep and beep for no discernible reason, most often in the dead of night.  A quick look at the unit indicates the connection is fine.Given that the monitor just seems so unreliable, I cannot rely on it and feel comfortable.  I have reached out to the company so we will see what they have to say.Bottom line- I would not buy this monitor again and indeed, would prefer to just return it. I am now considering buying the Infant Optics DXR-8, which I initially wanted based on its review, or even something simpler that will at least continue to serve its purpose."
"2814","1","At first we thought this monitor was great, you can use the app to view from your phone, but only for a limited time before you have to pay ( which is not noted on the box when we purchased). It frequently looses connection and then we are forced to readjust the wires while our daughter is trying to nap. Worst of all after less than a year of use the charging wire has wore and now no longer works ( we had to go out and buy a separate droid charger). At this price point the quality is terrible and did not last to our daughters first birthday- we are very dissapointed and will not be purchasing anything from Motorola in the future"
"2815","3","We've been using this camera for about 2 years since my daughter was born. The camera itself isn't bad, the monitor it comes with however is just horrible. We've used it in 2 places, a 3 bedroom house and a 2 bedroom apartment. In both places, the monitor will just lose signal and stop showing anything. At first, I thought maybe it was the wireless signal to the camera itself but when I use the Android or iPhone apps they work just fine, it's just the base/monitor that doesn't work right. Also, the music that it plays sounds bad and is just way too loud to sooth a baby to sleep."
"2816","1","This set is a waste of money.  We expected a high quality, reliable product from Motorola, and it turned out to be anything but that.  These do better as a paperweight.  The cameras struggle to connect to the monitor from 15ft away, so don<U+2019>t count on a 590ft span as advertised. The mobile app and the included monitor are unresponsive.  The included monitor frequently drops connection to the cameras and sounds off a loud alarm in the middle of the night.  The monitor is also difficult to configure and the touch keys are slow to reapond.  Pan/tilt/zoom features would be helpful if it didn<U+2019>t lag 20-30 seconds for each click.  If monitoring your child is important to you, consider another options. This is a terrible product and only leads to frustration down the road."
"2817","1","Do whatever you have to do to NOT get this baby monitor. On our first unit the capacitive buttons didn't work most of the time. When we contacted Motorola they said they would gladly get us a replacement unit, but they didn't have any at the moment and they weren't sure when they would have more. It took weeks of me emailing them to get a replacement.This second unit disconnects from the camera at least 2-3 times a day, which causes it to beep and beep and beep - until it randomly gets a signal from the camera again. Sometimes the camera beeps in the middle of the night - in the nursery.I honestly haven't looked into which baby monitor would be better than this one, but I can't imagine any of them being much worse."
"2818","2","Only reason this got two stars is because the night vision is very good, easy to see my daughter in near darkness. Now the downsides, the USB cables constantly fall out without even touching the monitor or cameras, to get them to connect at all is similar to getting a game to work on an old Nintendo pushing left, right, up, down, until the blue light finally shows it's connected, then the slightest touch disconnects power, and someone's gravity disconnects it, its that bad. Second issue is it constantly shows no wifi or randomly goes from 2-4 bars to 0 bars without moving anything, both the monitor and camera are within 30 feet of the router max and every other wifi device shows full strength connections from much further distances. If those two issues were sorted out this would be a great monitor, instead for every hour of use it stops working for one of those two reasons one to three times. Would never buy again, which is a shame because everything else is great."
"2819","3","I can't recommend this system. The connectivity is very flaky. I struggled to get a constant connection and all three rooms (Toddler, Infant, Parents) are on the same floor within 50-f of each other. When it does finally connect, the video quality on the handheld monitor is mediocre.The app is decent. Works well on my Note 4. I can't help but feel this unit makes a better security cam than a good baby monitor.The other big negative is there is no VOX. For this price point this feature should be present in the handheld/monitor software."
"2820","2","Paid $249.99 for something that is a piece of CRAP...No one can prepare you for delivering your baby at 28 weeks, so bringing our little one home after 56 days in the hospital was nerve wracking. We slept by his side for months before we transitioned him to his room. Opening the package and setting up the monitor gave me some anxiety. I knew it had to be done but had some reservations...what if it stops working and we don't hear him, was on the top of my list. Strike one...touch screen on the monitor didnt work so we returned it and got a new one. I got to sleep next to him longer!!! Now we make the transition and my biggest fear happened...strike two...new unit...went to bed with it fully charged only to have our daughter come up stairs with our little one screaming, looked at monitor and it was dead. I'm fuming, Emailed company and delt with issue. Ok so now a couple months have gone by and we notice the camera cord and where you plug it into the camera, is loose and being finicky...strike three. I start sleeping by my son again because here comes the fear. So now I have been sleeping, for a month, by our son, only for...the cord for the monitor to become loose and continuously fall out, piece of crap...strike four. We reach out to the company, got a new system, charged it for 16 hours per instructions and were already to go. Ahhhh my bed again after a month downstairs. First night everything looks good and SOUNDS good, I do a check at 1:30am and everything is good. Around 6am my husband gets up to use the restroom and screams, ""he is hysterically crying"". In a daze I look at monitor to see our son in a ball in the corner of his crib...but I HEAR NOTHING. We run downstairs and scoop him up. He's been sobbing and can barely breathe...how long had this been going on...strike five. I have no clue why there was no sound. I broke down and cried. Shame on you as a company for putting out such a crappy product. Shame one us for not dumping this system after the first malfunction. NEVER USE THIS PIECE IF CRAP!!!!!!!!!"
"2821","1","This camera is a piece of crap. Purchased it because it had all the features we wanted and thought Motorola was a trusted and quality brand. Bought the first one right after my first kid was born. Immediately had issues right out of the box. The video would only show up in the color green and the monitor would CONSTANTLY pan to the right. Boxed that heap of junk up and returned it. Thinking I just got a defective one I went and bought another one.All seemed fine and dandy until a few months later. Now this piece of junk pans whenever it feels like and the camera won't even charge unless I wrap the cord around it in some sort ridiculous configuration.  Sometimes I get a good stretch of a few weeks without and problems.  And the nights like tonight (the reason I'm even writing a review) I wake up in the middle of the night hearing that god awful beep because the screen locks after a minute of non operation and it thinks I'm pressing the pan right button. This thing has a mind of its own. It could very well be one of the most annoying things I own..."
"2822","1","Most of what this camera and monitor does it does well, but it does one thing that makes it unuseable.When the handheld monitor is on, my WiFi connection speeds on all other devices is destroyed. I have tested this over multiple days, using speedtest.net on both my laptop and my phone. With both the camera and monitor off, connection speeds are normal. With just the camera on, speeds stay normal. As soon as the monitor is on, speeds plummet. As soon as I turn off the monitor, speeds return to normal.I just verified this again. With the monitor off, download speeds average 31.71Mbps. 5 seconds after turning on the monitor speeds dropped to 1.00Mbps. I turned the monitor off, speeds back to 29.56Mbps. I tested using Speedtest.Net app. I tested on my phone and on my laptop.I emailed Motorola support and this is their response:""It is possible that your monitor affects your internet speed. This can be avoided by making sure that either the monitor or the camera is at least 2 meters away from the router. If both the parent and baby unit are within a 2-meter range of the router, your internet speed may slow down.""Both the camera and the monitor are away from the router. This isn't a problem. I've moved the camera all over the house, and I've moved the monitor all over the house, every time I get the same results.Bottom line, this unit will kill your WiFi and make it unusable. If you don't care about being able to access the internet, stream audio or video, browse the web, etc., then this unit should work well for you. Otherwise, DO NOT BUY!!"
"2823","2","We bought this camera while I was pregnant and tested it out, everything worked great! The picture quality was amazing and it worked well with Hubble. No lag at all. My daughter is now 1 and slowly over time the camera has just gotten worst and worst. Now, the picture quality is so blurry I can't even tell where my daughter is at in her crib at night. Sometimes the camera doesn't move at all when I try to adjust angles. The temperature is so off sometimes saying it's 37 degrees in our house. The only reason this is getting two stars is because is did work PERFECT at the beginning. We have done nothing but have it mounted to the wall the entire time. I contacted customer service and sent them pictures of the low quality picture and all they told me to do was a hard reset which did nothing. Don't buy this camera. We are now currently looking for a new one."
"2824","1","Please do not buy this camera if you want to keep your sanity as a new parent. I'm 18 months in and finally giving up and buying a new one. I have tried and tried to make this work. I'm on my 3rd warranty replacement and now I am out of warranty. The monitor likes to go out add odd times, and it beeps really really loud. I've reset the touchscreen, the cameras, I've done everything. We even moved and got new wifi and it still does it. Not fun to wake up at 4am by your monitor loses connection with your screen for a few minutes. Not to mention all the previous issues with the screen going out that had to be replaced 3 times. Save yourself and do not buy Motorola!!!"
"2825","2","I have had this monitor for just over a year now. I wanted a monitor with wifi to view on my phone as well. This one has had problems out of the box.Cons:The built in kick stand, when in use, would put pressure on the monitor and cause it to beep like I was pushing buttons on the front. It finally broke off and can't be re-attached. It hasn't lost signal a lot but when it does (sometimes when I'm only one room away) it makes a beeping noise on the camera that wakes up my baby. The charging cord for the monitor is useless after just a year. It will no longer stay in place when plugged in. My latest problem is with the sound. For the second time in 2 weeks the sound on the monitor does not work. I have to unplug the camera to reset it and make the sound work again. Who knows how long this will work before I can't get any sound anymore. Very disappointed in this monitor.Pros: the picture is clear, even in IR mode (maybe I got the old version of their camera before Motorola changed and got cheaper cameras from China). I love being able to view using the Hubble app on my phone when I'm not home.  I have rarely had problems with the Hubble app and connecting to the camera. The size of the screen on the monitor is great. My sister has an older Motorola camera and monitor that has lasted her 4+ years but this one is obviously cheaply made and definitely not worth the money."
"2826","1","I am so sad this monitor didn't work for us. It was an item I added to our registry because I trusted the Motorola name. Unfortunately I should have found another monitor. The sound went out on the video screen after just a few months of use. On top of that, the charging plug never seemed to connect right so we had to tape the connection and just pray it would work through the night. I'm really sad it didn't work out. It was purchased early in my pregnancy so by the time this stuff started happening, we were outside the warranty."
"2827","1","This is a terrible monitor, especially for how expensive it was when I bought it.  The night vision is poor quality, the monitor beeps constantly, the app never seems to work, and worst of all, the charger frayed and broke within a couple months of use, rendering the monitor useless.  I contacted Motorola to replace it, and I have literally spent over an hour on hold with customer service employees who have no idea what they're doing.  They said they would replace the charger, but after the first time I called and waited a half an hour on hold, I was told they didn't have it in stock and to call back in three days.  It's been over a week, and it's still not in stock, and no one has any idea when it will be.  I've asked to speak to a supervisor, but none are ever available, and no one returns my calls.  This is the last time I will buy anything from Motorola."
"2828","1","At first seems like an excellent camera. I do love the app option. However! This camera drops connectivity from our WiFi all the time; which is not always easy to reconnect to both the parent monitor AND the app. And it<U+2019>s definitely not my router issue (I<U+2019>m in IT and have looked at all possibilities on my end). After a couple months it had issues with simply moving the camera view. You have to hold down for several seconds and then it doesn<U+2019>t stop which is very frustrating. Like someone else mentioned, I very much wanted to like this camera and gave it MANY chances but now I just cannot in good conscience give anything but one star (or lower if allowed). Very unfortunate! :("
"2829","1","My wife and I received this camera as a gift. I have lost sleep tirelessly trying to figure out how in the world this has received 3 out of 5 stars. I want to meet the people who gave it anything above the 1 star that you must give because you can't give a zero.""I have never experienced a product that is more worthy of the term garbage"", says my local garbage man who sees a ton of garbage on a daily basisFrom the start, setting this thing up is like trying to figure out the opposite sex. I'm pretty techy and have a house full of home automated devices. It is 2016, setting these types of products up should NOT be difficult for anyone. Setting this up made me feel like I was setting up a cool new high tech device in 1991. Everyone and their mother has their own camera and they are all super easy to set up. This is clearly too difficult for Motorola. Picture quality? Garbage. Sound? Garbage. The quality of the components? Not bad.....just kidding they're too GARBAGE. I have to rig the power cord in a certain position JUST TO KEEP THE DEVICE POWERED. At Motorola, it isn't enough to simply plug in, you have to have the wire in a specific position and DO NOT TOUCH to get juice. I am only doing this while I wait for Customer Service to open so I can plead with this devil company to return and get something that actually works. I beg ALL new parents out there, please do not purchase this. You have been warned and by now purchasing this you are admitting you do not care about your child. Have a great Sunday, except you Motorola."
"2830","1","We have been using this video monitor for a year and have not had a good experience from the get-go. While the camera hasn't given us any problems, the monitor itself has several issues. The plastic around the antenna has fallen off, and the battery life has deteriorated significantly. The unit can't survive 20 minutes without needing to be plugged in. Now we're having trouble getting the monitor to charge at all because you have to set it up ""just so."" For the money we spent, this product should have lasted us much longer. I've contacted Motorola's customer service, and they refuse to replace or fix the unit because it's now beyond warranty. I would recommend purchasing a different video monitor."
"2831","2","I *hate* this monitor. I hate it so much, when it failed completely (due to a firmware update pushed through by Motorola) I was thrilled. Motorola offered to send us a new one (in just a few short weeks! A lifetime when you have an infant to obsess over), but we just returned it to the store.Cons:- The sound on the parent unit is horrible, which is confusing because the sound through the app is fantastic. Not sure what the issue is, but even with the volume turned all the way up and the speaker pressed tightly against my ear, I could barely hear my kiddo's scream cries.- There's a significant delay, both over wifi and via the parent unit. As a result, we hear everything in our house twice when we have the monitors up and working.- The camera is enormous. Are they all this clunky?- The app has outages all the time.- Motorola fried our parent unit with a firmware update and from what I understand this happens fairly frequently.- We got two cameras -- the one that came with the parent unit and a second one for another room in our house. The camera that came with the parent unit had pretty poor video quality; the other one was fantastic. This sort of inconsistency is baffling.- $300 and $100 for another camera? ... ?!?!?! For this price it should be perfect.Pros:- On the good camera, the video quality is great. Even with night vision.- There are tons of features. Caveat: we never use 90% of them. We like the pan/tilt/zoom, but never play music through the app and two-way talking is scary! Our kiddo is really little still, maybe this would help with a two year old. Mostly, my husband uses it to terrify me in the middle of the night.- The picture and sound are pretty solid through the app. When it works."
"2832","4","On paper, this has all the 'right' features.- Pan/Tilt has a typical amount of delay. You can't track a moving object. The intention is to find the perfect angle and leave it there. Very rarely, do we ever change the angle once its set.- Image is as good as any non-HD monitor we've used. Honestly, we don't feel like we 'need' better, but it would have ben nice at this pice.- The colored noise level meter is handy.- The kick stand is not adjustable. It's either out, or not, and that's just fine.- The talk features is nice, but the voice quality is spotty depending on the connection.- Temperature display is very important to us because our nursery can get pretty hot when the sun's up and the curtain is open.- Viewability via internet is a huge bonus that's not often found at this price.- 2 cameras preprogrammed for the technically disinclined that cannot connect their own.However, one of the most important elements that is often overlooked when shopping for baby monitors, is signal-retention. Like many modern homes, my house is full of radio signals (wireless router, wi-fi boosters, cellphones, bluetooth speakers, cordless phones, ambient radio/TV waves, microwave oven, etc.) and this makes interference a very common issue for simple devices like a baby monitor because many of them are running on old-tech. We now have a total of 5 baby monitors and this is the latest. Of them, this one holds a signal well. When a signal is dropped, it a loud alarm chirps which can disrupt yours or the baby's sleep. Annoying to say the least. That said, the signal strength meter is not trustworthy. A few times, it chirped out even though it had 3 bars.Side-note: We also own a Motorola MBP33S which looks very similar, but it does not connect to the monitor.BOTTOM LINE: This is probably the best overall monitor we own. Other reviewers seem to disagree. But for our use, performance has been pretty solid. I suspect it may be a quality control issue. We got lucky. I only wish the signal retention was better. It's good, but not flawless and it may sound hyper-critical, but it's really not that high of a bar. For example, our favorite monitor, and also our pick for value-leader, has flawless signal retention at a third of the cost.<U+00A0>Summer Infant Baby Secure"
"2833","1","I am never one to write reviews, but this monitor is so awful I felt I needed to. First of all, the amount of time it takes the monitor to connect to the camera almost every time I use it is absurd. I put the baby to bed and have to stand there waiting 5-10 minutes for the monitor to stop beeping and display the picture. The monitor itself does not hold a charge, which means it is not portable since it has to be plugged into the wall almost constantly. The Hubble app is garbage, it took almost 30 minutes to connect. The video is laggy and the sound quality is awful as well. Honestly, for the amount of money this costs I would have been better off buying a Nest camera or some other type of in home security camera. Do not waste your money on a monitor that doesn't work."
"2834","5","This monitor had everything I was looking for in a system. It gives you the option to view baby with the handheld monitor or with your phone. I use both options constantly.  With the handheld monitor you are able to view baby constantly at home and use your phone as you like. We prop ours up after she's gone to bed and we are cooking or watching tv.  The phone app option is wonderful as well because I can view baby from work or if I'm out and someone is babysitting. The grandparents love using it to check in on baby when they can't see her I also love that you can set notifications on the phone app so if baby moves or makes any noise you will be alerted. You can change the sensitivity (3 option levels) as well. This works even if you're only using the handheld device, if baby wakes it will alert your phone. The handheld and the app also give you options to check the temperature in the room, play music for the baby, talk through the camera to the baby, move camera angles, zoom, and take a picture.  It also logs a picture of movement on the app so if you miss something you can view back. Overall I love this monitor because it allows me two different ways to view (wi-fi and handheld), the picture is good, and the notifications to my phone make me feel secure. I've already been recommending it to all my friends expecting! Its slightly more expensive than other monitors on the market but thats because it gives two options unlike all the other monitors that are only one option."
"2835","1","We received this monitor as a gift, and it worked just fine for the first 6 months, despite a really poorly designed user interface and buttons that were very noisy at night. However, all of a sudden the camera would no longer connect to the monitor. Customer support is only available on weekdays and we didn't want to wait until Monday, so we decided to go ahead and buy a replacement camera. When we tried to pair it with the monitor, we received the same error.  We called customer support, but were told by the automated menu system that we ""must have the serial number and receipt ready. If we do not, we should hang up and call back when we do."" This is absolutely ridiculous! We received this monitor as a gift, and I'm sure many others did as well. The automated menu indicated Motorola would refuse to speak to us unless we had our receipt. BAD customer service!!  Thankfully, because we had 2 cameras that we tried to pair at the same time, we were able to uninstall the first camera completely and it re-paired at that time. If we ever need another baby monitor, we will not be buying from Motorola. I suggest you avoid this product as well."
"2836","1","This is really a terrible camera, please avoid.  We have two, one works ""ok"", not great and the picture is low quality, but at least it functions.  The other will only connect for an hour or so at a time then it disconnects until we power cycle it.  I've been dealing with support for weeks now, they won't do anything to fix it.  They escalated the case to a second level of support over a week ago, and there's been no word.  So, my choices are to not have a baby monitor, or buy something different.  You can guess what I chose.  I'll be avoiding all Motorola products after this, it's a shame they used to be a decent company."
"2837","4","Awesome picture. Good connection to wifi. Music plays clear and consistent. Voice comes through clear when you speak through the app. Easy to set up and mount. Tells you temp in room, will alert if temp drops. Movement can also send an alert to you as well as sound. Camera tilts up, down, right and left for a great view of the room.I will update if the app has issues or is buggy but reviews of app are good so I don't expect many issues.This is a high quality product. We were tearing our hair out with gynoii's product and this is a 1000x better than that."
"2838","1","The only function this serves is as a paper weight. We are on our third replacement and it still doesn't work. Customer service is a joke. We have had to create four help tickets on this replacement for the same issue. After each contact they close out the case number and you have to start over. I will never buy another Motorola product again."
"2839","4","The Hubble baby monitor comes with two cameras and a monitor unit.  The cameras will record sound and video and monitor temperature, movement and sound.  The video recording works in the dark as well. The camera can be remotely controlled to pan side to side and up and down.The cameras will connect to your home's wifi network to provide remote viewing via a smartphone application.After using the Hubble for a month we are impressed by the utility of it.  The only difficulties were getting the cameras to connect to the wifi -- it seemed unable to see our hidden network.  I got frustrated and gave up.  I came back around to it a couple days later and was able to connect easily.Monitoring from the app is okay but not great.  Of course there's a delay, but very often the app will complain about a low bandwidth connection.  Occasionally there is trouble connecting to the camera feed.  Other times it seems to work flawlessly.  I think they're still sorting out some of the details.I love the fact that up to 4 cameras can be added to the system.  The Hubble is compatible with different Motorola cameras.You can customize the alerts the camera sends you and for a small subscription fee you can have video footage saved on the Hubble website.It's a nice set up and I'd recommend it whether you want to monitor a baby, your pets or just general activity in your home while you're away."
"2840","1","I would give this monitor zero stars if Amazon would let me.1. The camera stopped connecting to Bluetooth/internet after only 3 months.2. The night vision is awful. You have to keep some sort of light on in the room in order to see anything! (In comparison, I have the Nest security camera on my first floor and you can see perfectly in pitch blackness with their night vision)3. The handheld parent unit only kept a charge for about an hour when it was brand new, which has since gone down dramatically.4. The mini usb used toCharge the handheld parent unit will not correct, or charge any longer, making the whole monitor obsolete"
"2841","1","We purchased this camera in December 2016 and have had nothing but issues with it since then. The monitor is poorly constructed such that inserting the usb charger eventually breaks the usb port. We went through two monitors and then just used the wifi functionality through the app. Motorola periodically rolls out firmware and software updates which cause the camera to unpredictably disconnect and requires a completely new set up. This is a highly unreliable device. I would not recommend it to anyone. Motorola should be ashamed their name is attached to such a poor product. I will second guess other Motorola products as a result of this poor experience."
"2842","1","This camera is a complete waste of money. I've now read other reviews and realize this is a common theme with these cameras. The picture has turned completely grainy and dark - it's impossible to even see my baby. if I could give this less than one star I would. The touch screen works poorly, most of the time the camera doesn't load on the app, the picture is horrendous, the sound quality is awful - what a load of junk."
"2843","1","Having the same issues as others I cant get past the set and keep receiving set up has failed please restart set up which I have tried at least 20+ times called motarola and that was useless all they said was to send the unit back and they would replace it, WTH??? she had no other help for me and offered no kind of advice or trouble shooting help whats the point of calling then very unhappy especially for the money spent ! I am taking it back this is ridiculous"
"2844","2","We received this as a gift for our baby shower. We have not been impressed with it at all. The sound on the parent unit stopped working within a week or so of using it. Motorola did send us a new parent unit quickly, which I appreciated. However, the parent unit still loses its connection with the camera very frequently (and the only way to fix that is to sneak into a sleeping baby's room to turn the camera off and on). As others have mentioned, the night vision is AWFUL. Its almost impossible to figure out what you are looking at. The parent unit does not hold a charge for long at all.Finally, the wifi connection with the Hubble app is useless. We have high speed wifi at our house, and I think the app has connected to the camera once in the 5 months we've tried it. I think there are way better options out there at this price point."
"2845","1","My husband and I purchased this monitor for our son who was born two years ago. It was working great but honestly it would constantly drop the signal and then beep during the night waking me up. I would have to turn on the monitor and then it would re establish the connection. It also would lose the signal all together and then we would have to restart the camera and reboot the whole system. But because we liked the benefits (good range and quality of picture) we continued dealing with the issues. Then two months ago we purchased a second camera with the arrival of our daughter and from the first day we mounted and started using the cameras and connections have been having tons of issues. Both drop the sound and can't hear my children. Sometime the sound will work and then drop in the middle of the night and I won't be aware that I can't hear my children. For the cost of the system I would have thought this wouldn't be something that would happen. We are so dissatisfied that we are now looking into other systems. I would be very careful about this monitor because it is very expensive and with all the dropped connections and now adding the second camera for more money and neither working its not worth it."
"2846","1","Please do yourself a favor and do NOT buy this product. We have had this camera for slightly more than the 12 months that is covered by the warranty. The camera will no longer pan up and down and since we have had more than 12 months Motorola is refusing to do anything about it. I have tried working with them on a number of occasions but each time they tell me to connect it to another app and try to update the firmware, when I do so, the app and camera will not sync even when i am selecting my camera. Horrible product that will only give you a headache. Even when the camera would work it required almost weekly firmware updates which required the user to reset the camera and then re-pair back to the mobile app. Way too much work for a camera that should work out of the box."
"2847","3","I gave this product a 3 star not necessarily because of the product but the Hubble server you use for wifi.  The problem I did have with the product is it did drive me nuts that when you hit a button it would beep with no way to turn that off.  Minor but it drove me crazy!  The issue with Hubble is that they aren't as secure as I thought they were as someone hacked our account today!  We got these cameras on May 16.  Last couple weeks I noticed the camera wouldn't be in the same spot I always kept them on our kids beds, I brushed it off as my husband looked at them while at work.  However today I saw my daughters camera move on the parent unit, so I switched it to my sons & his was zoomed in on him.  I immediately called my husband & he said he hadn't logged in at all, so I went to the app to log in to try to change password & it wouldn't let me log in, I texted my husband who then tried & was unsuccessful as well.  Needless to say, I'm returning these & getting ones that don't require wi-fi."
"2848","1","My wife and I used a Motorola monitor for my son and loved it, it was not wifi. When my wife became pregnant again, we wanted a dual camera monitor wiih wifi. This has all the features we were looking for. The app with this camera works well but the monitor is garbage. We got this package and excitedly set it up. Once the set up was complete we tried it out. It seemed to work well and we didn't notice the major flaw at first. We used it on my son, two and a half years old, the first night. This is before my daughter was born. It seemed to be OK, we turned on the remote sound maker on the camera and it worked, the major problem here is that the speaker that plays the music in my son's room is one inch away from the mic. So, when my son would make noise, we didn't hear it, all we could hear was the music being played. That wasn't the deal breaker, we went back to using his music player that worked so well with our old monitor. Then we realized we barely could hear anything in his room. I turned the volume up completely and we still couldn't hear anything from my son's room. when he woke up in the morning I checked the monitor and if I held it up to my ear i could hear him yelling my name. With his old monitor would I could hear him moving in his bed before he even made a noise and the volume was only turned about half way up. There was no way i was going to risk not hearing my newborn daughter. We returned the monitor and got another one. The new one was the exact same. The features of this set are very attractive, but the speaker is horrible. I don't care how many extras it has, if I find my kids screaming in the beds because the monitor volume doesn't work, I will not use the product. After searching online for a solution, I found many people had this problem.I emailed Motorola customer support to see if there was anything that I was doing wrong. I told them I had the monitor volume at the highest setting and couldn't hear anything. They responded and explained that the monitor is set to medium at the factory and i need to turn the volume up in the settings. I am a mechanical engineer, obviously I turned up the volume before I contacted them for support."
"2849","1","DO NOT BUY A MOTOROLA BABY MONITOR!!!!!! I have now bought 2 different versions of this monitor, and both have stopped working within a few months past when their 1 year warranty expires. Motorola's customer service is terrible!!! They will absolutely not replace/fix your product if it is even a day past the 1 year, and you will be left with almost $300 worth of garbage. I know of others that have had the same problem. There is clearly a defect in this product."
"2850","1","Horrible video monitor, especially for a $300 monitor.  I returned this monitor and opted for one that was half the cost.  Do not buy this monitor!  For me,  like other reviews I've read,  it's very glitchy. My monitor would beep during the night,  notifying me that the battery was dying, even though it was plugged in.  Other times the screen would flash and beep for no reason. I would turn off the monitor in the middle of the night to stop the beeping,  defeating the purpose of having a monitor.  In this case, more expensive does not equal higher quality."
"2851","1","Don't get this if you need reliability.  The Hubble app is so bad, it works 10% of the time and out of no where it'll start telling me there is motion but it's from past days/times.Even the handheld unit doesn't work all the time, it often freezes and/or makes random beeping noises.  I've contact support and they don't know why it would happen except for poor reception; but it can happen when I'm across the hall.Just don't get this camera, it's too overpriced for something that only works sometimes."
"2852","1","So disappointed in this product! It worked great for maybe the first 3 months and then like other users have said, it started to lose its connectivity. It periodically kicks out for no reason and then chooses whether or not it wants to reconnect. My husband and I have resorted to multiple times a day either unplugging it from the wall or turning it off/on to try and get it to work better. The higher than 3 star reviews here have to be from people who recently bought the product so they haven't experienced the problems yet. Please don't waste your money on this product. I just really wished this was better made because it is a great product when it chooses to work. We will be buying another product shortly because we can no longer handle the frustration that comes with buying this product."
"2853","1","DO NOT BUY!  Our newborn was born in November and we started using the monitor in December.  Not even 4 months of use and the unit has failed.  Not only did it fail, but the monitor started smoking and smelling like an electrical fire at 2:30 a.m.  I've called Motorola directly to resolve and they offered me a lesser model.  I refused and am still waiting for a call back from the manager.  Terrible customer service and a DANGEROUS product!!"
"2854","1","I've had to have this product replaced twice. One monitor died, one camera died, 3 charging ports went out, but you would think, that's okay because it's under warranty, right? However, the customer service is terrible: 1 Hour phone call the first time, 45 phone call the second time...and that's really hard while working a full-time job. But the worst part, is that their new policy is to make you ship in the broken product before they ship the replacement out, so you're just without a baby monitor for about a week!! PLEASE STAY AWAY! MOTOROLA has caused me so many tears! Oh and the Wifi is completely undependable, but I expected that before I bought it because of the reviews on all the wifi products."
"2855","5","Prior to ordering this product we were using a Levana Stella monitor. It's a decent monitor but was lacking in a few areas.Where the Motorola shines:-Wi-Fi: This isn't much of a comparison since our Levana didn't have Wi-Fi capability but is definitely worth noting. Having the ability to check in on baby from my phone makes life so much easier. In a world where I seem to be constantly juggling items from room to room, being able to use my phone when I don't want to carry around the monitor is a nice touch.-Infrared night vision: The night vision on this monitor is impressive. The picture quality is crisp, just as it is in the daytime.-Two-way communication: I love the ability to communicate through the monitor. If baby wakes up when I'm in another area of the house it's nice to be able to let him know with the push of a button that everything is ok and I'm on my way. I know this is a pretty standard feature at this point but is still one of my favorites.-Ability to record video: This is amazing and I wish I had had a monitor capable of doing this all along. Just as head's up, this unit does not come with a memory (SD) card so one will have to be purchased in order to utilize this feature.-Temperature monitoring: Oh how I wished my Levana had this. We live in an older house and rooms can get drafty at times. It's nice to be able to keep tabs on the temperature in baby's room so we can adjust as needed.Overall: I'm extremely pleased with this monitor. It's everything I wanted in a monitor and I really have nothing negative to say about it. Great product!"
"2856","2","Bought this item in Hong Kong.  Not too many choices.  I previously had a Summer monitor, 4 years old now.  With a new baby just born, i wanted to have a new monitor where i could connect two cameras.  Bought this item, and returned it 3 days later.  The night vision is poor, can barely see the babies in low light.  The connectivity is very poor.  Same distance as my Summer Monitor but the motorola could not get a signal from the cameras.  This is less than 15 feet away.  Quality of image is good but not high def as advertised.  I returned it and did not get a refund.  Instead had to exchange the value ($450 USD in Hong Kong - everything more expensive) for things i really did not need or want.  I would not recommend this monitor to anyone.  I wish I had seen the reviews prior to my purchase."
"2857","1","DO NOT BUY THIS MONITOR!We have had problems with it since the first week. For $300 you would expect a product that works. You would be wrong. First, the monitor freezes (and we have to reset) it almost every day.Second, the charging plug no longer connects to the monitor without jiggling the plug for several minutes. If you just plug the cord into the monitor and walk away, there's a 90% chance the monitor isn't actually charging. The result, a dead monitor.Third, the monitor has started to malfunction daily. It will beep over and over and over without being touched. When you try to stop the beeping by turning it off, the power button doesn't work. The solution? Reset the entire unit.If these problems only happened once a month, I probably wouldn't care. When it happens every day or every other day, it's very frustrating, especially considering the price. When the unit is working, it works well. The trouble is the unit rarely works for long without something going wrong. I would recommend looking at a different brand."
"2858","1","So disappointed. First, the app associated with this product is awful. As I sit and write this review, the app is not working and the motorola network is down, which means I can't monitor my baby on my phone or by logging in online. If I can't monitor the baby, my wife can't. If my wife can't monitor the baby, I get in trouble. Not cool, motorola.The pan/tilt function is terrible. One little tap and the camera swings across the room. And you can't stop it. So you try to tap the opposite arrow and it flies in the other direction.Video quality is bad. It's grainy, the night vision is bad and it freezes.Do yourself a favor and invest in something better."
"2859","1","Hey new parents the Motorola Hubble Baby Monitor is terrible. If their servers go down you are out of luck (going on three days now) and their customer service is Eastern Bloc at best. At $150.00 a pop you would expect more but alas save your money and but something else. Anything else like bread or soda or tacos or rocks I mean anything."
"2860","1","I loathe this monitor and am so disappointed that I ever purchased it.  It's ridiculously expensive for what you get, and I wish I just stuck with the Summer Infant digital monitor and skipped the wi-fi part...because it doesn't even work!  The app and the handheld always lose connection with the camera.  I am constantly having to go restart the camera to get it to connect..not very convenient in the middle of the night when the viewing monitor beeps at you when it loses connection.  So I now have the monitor to wake me up on top of the baby.  The app (the whole reason I went with this monitor) freezes up and is useless with a cellular connection.  What's the point of a monitor if it doesn't actually help you monitor your child?  Save your money."
"2861","4","We have had this monitor for almost 5 months and it works great if you have great home Wi-Fi.  We brought it up to a cabin with no internet and the camera kept disconnecting. We would have to shut off the camera and restart so that it would connect again every time we turned off the monitor and back on.  It was annoying but manageable.  When the Wi-Fi is good and strong it is an awesome monitor.  We love the capabilities of using the hand held,  phones,  iPads,  etc to connect and view.  I especially liked using it on a girls night out to spy on daddy and baby<U+0001F61C>"
"2862","2","Not a good quality product.  About to get my second replacement unit.  The first replacement only lasted a month.  Audio issues with both and key issues with the second.Online web portal is unreliable.  Night vision is not the best, need at least two nightlights on in the room to see baby in the crib.Motorola support is easy to contact and quick to replace units.  (That is why 2 stars instead of 1 star)"
"2863","2","Not what I expectedQuality is perfectSound is perfectNight vision greatIf you try to use WIFi it's so badMy router is netgear  6300v2My internet connection is 109mb down and 40mb upload ..And the camera is moving so slowwCamera Firmware is 01.17.22"
"2864","2","Expensive and doesn't performThis monitor is unreliable and not user friendly for the price. The night vision is poor. The control console freezes and doesn't always display the current image or sound. The navigation menu isn't user friendly and the control panel is always on lock mode meaning you must unlock it anytime you want to do anything- move camera, zoom, increase volume, etc. also the music mode feature didn't work for the first month of using the product. When you selected a music tone by pushing play it only played for a few seconds and cut off.The Hubble app to use your phone with this device is very poor quality. There's always connection or server problems preventing you from logging in and seeing the camera display.I don't recommend paying for this product. Try something else less expensive. You may not be as frustrated when it doesn't work because you haven't spent $300"
"2865","1","This camera is the absolute worst!!!!!!!! I paid the extra  $ for this camera as it was the only one I was finding with a screen so I wouldn't have to use my phone/tablet for viewing all the time. After a couple months the screen stopped connecting to the camera, I could get sound and it showed the temperature but no picture. I emailed the company and they said to try a reset, this never worked. Emailed them back and told them this and they never responded. On top of that now the camera is not connecting to my phone or tablet. Purchasing this monitor is plain out ROBBERY!!!!!"
"2866","1","My husband bought this somewhere else but I am so mad at this piece of *carp* The <U+201C>wireless<U+201D> never worked, temperature gage is ALWAYS wrong, don<U+2019>t even think about moving the lens around as it won<U+2019>t go back to its original spot. Their app tries to look <U+201C>high-tech<U+201D> but it<U+2019>s not. I had a green screen on my app for a WEEK, so when the app actually worked, it bottoms out.  And these are the things I can live with.  DO NOT BUY THIS - YOU WILL REGRET IT."
"2867","1","We have had this monitor as our primary baby monitor for a while now and since day 1 it has worked sub-optimal with poor/spotty performance, intermittently cutting out video and sound, and most recently with the inability to charge the parent unit. The two micro-usb plugs that insert into the camera and parent unit have NEVER stayed snug into their connectors and now the parent unit does not charge whatsoever. Called Motorola to explain the problem and was offered the chance to buy a replacement parent unit for ""only $120 on Amazon!"" Awful customer service ,awful product - will never purchase from Motorola again."
"2868","2","I have been pretty disappointed with this product. It has a history shutting off randomly. Cameras are not consistent with their clarity. The one camera we have views great! But our second one is not as clear. The microphone to speak is a really nice feature. It also will loose signal randomly. Overall does not work consistently"
"2869","1","I was SO excited to get this monitor. My husband is in the military and we live in Japan and received this as a baby shower gift. The set up was easy and it paired with our phones great! Our little one was born in September and we started using the monitor right away. It worked perfectly for the first 4 weeks and then the monitor wouldn't connect to the camera. Neither would our phones. The light on the camera was blue but it was registering as offline. I tried EVERYTHING to get it to work again. I talked with customer support and finally they said I would need to file a claim to get a new one since it was still under warranty, ok great. I called and was told since I live in Japan and took it out of the country it voided the warranty! WHAT?!?!?! I have a friend with the same one here and it works great for her so I know it has nothing to do with the country. I am so upset about this! I basically have a $300 paper weight now!"
"2870","1","I was so happy with this product for the first two weeks of my baby's life, but all that came to a screeching halt in mid-December 2015 when the parent unit abruptly stopped working one evening saying that it couldn't find the camera.  Since then I have been using it through the app only and I have called Motorola on 5 different occasions to try to resolve the issue.  Through these phone calls I have been given a string of lies about needing to wait for an update, that a MONTH later still has not occurred.  On the phone today, 1/14/16, I was told by a customer service supervisor that she could send out a replacement product,  but there was only a 50% chance that the replacement would work due to the technological glitch.  To make matters worse, they won't refund me for the product because it was purchased for us as a gift off of our registry and I do not have an original receipt.  Needless to say, DO NOT PUT THIS PRODUCT ON YOUR REGISTRY OR PURCHASE IT - unless you're comfortable gambling with your money on 50-50 odds."
"2871","1","This product is a great concept, but that's it. The first monitor we ordered had to be replaced immediately since sound was nearly nonexistent from the handheld monitor at full volume. The replacement had been working until about 9 months later, at which point the camera would move to the up most position on it's own and was really difficult to get down to the desired view. At 12.5 months the base monitor would not connect to the camera at all. Perfect timing since Motorola only warranties their product for 1 year, and has only given me the option to purchase yet another unit at a reduced rate. Garbage product, garbage support!"
"2872","5","We have had zero problems with this device. We really like it! I can check in from work to see or hear how things are going. There have been a handful of times when my wife could not get the monitor to work(when I got home I simply pressed and held the reset button...problem solved)When we first bought the unit, there was no ceiling mount option making the unit almost pointless, shortly after, they updated the software and the ceiling mount option was gladly welcomed!I recommend this product to pretty much everyone. I just wish the baby stores would carry stand alone cameras so that we could add on to the ""system""..."
"2873","2","Great features and it is fantastic while it works.  It's a rare unit with both WiFi and standalone capabilities.  I've gone through 3 Motorola's in the past 4 years.  Most die to issues where the power cord connects to the parent unit.  Something on the jack fails so the battery cannot be charged.  Tried replacing the cord but no luck.  Luckily since this is WiFi, I'm able to use my iPad as a monitor until I buy something new."
"2874","1","At first, we enjoyed this monitor, despite the regular disconnecting it was doing in its own (which reconnected independently). But within 6 months of use, it stopped taking a charge very well, and would disconnect and not reconnect regularly. Then, to make thingns worse.... it BEEPS in the baby's room when the disconnect happens. What exactly is the point of that?! Sure the monitor should alert me that it's disconnected but WHY ON EARTH WOULD ANYONE WANT IT TO ALERT THE BABY?! For an expensive and new monitor, this is an extreme disappointment. They should be ashamed for taking advantage of new parents, and their limited funds."
"2875","5","I recently upgraded my old Motorola baby monitoring system to the MBP 853 CONNECT 2.  It is awesome.  We had a great experience with our previous Motorola monitor but this one is even better.  I love the quality of the picture and the ease in which the camera moves.  You a really able to get a clear shot anywhere in the room and with a toddler and a newborn this is really helpful.  It also has a great user friendly interface. The ability to connect to wifi and access remotely is great and has come in very handy.  I also LOVE that is model allows us to monitor the temperature in the room.  We live in an older house that can be quite drafty in the winter and is using the older steam heat radiators and this has given my piece of mind to ensure the kiddos are warm and snugly without overheating! The music is also a nice added touch! I would highly recommend getting the MBP 853 CONNECT 2!"
"2876","2","Pros:- Excellent picture quality- Excellent sound quality both for camera and monitor.- Excellent white noise canceling- Loved having the clock on the camera<U+2014>when it worked. It would occasionally be hours off out of the blue. This may have been disturbed by the wifi being set up as noted below in consCons:- Unavoidable beeping for each button pushed to check on the kids-- annoying in middle of the night- When you turn screen light off at night for example, at some point it would turn back on in a soft glow but the picture wasn<U+2019>t real time so you<U+2019>d get a false sense of security your little one was ok unless you updated the picture- Split screen view (if you have 2 cameras on two kids) can only hear audio through one camera unless you move the dial over to the other camera making this feature stupid. I loved the idea of this feature vs. the scan feature but because I wanted to see both kids 100% of the time but you can<U+2019>t see and hear both at the same time. You can't even see both at the same time and have the audio scan.- Temperature wasn<U+2019>t accurate but you can adapt to this and adjust in your head what the room temp should be- Wifi sucks and we think this is what made the camera loudly beep in the middle of the night letting us know that it had lost connection once we set this feature up.-  wifi may have also messed up the accuracy of the clock as mentioned above- Not completely user friendly<U+2014>I was dreading teaching my parents how to use this- The kickstand is flat out stupid for a monitor of this size. It<U+2019>s flimsy. Also, it<U+2019>s covers the left 1/3 of the monitor making it hard to balance on an arm chair.- Camera is slightly delayed- The music was weird. Not something we<U+2019>d use.Overall: Wanted to love this monitor as the 3 positive features I listed we<U+2019>re really well done, however, the cons were so bad that this camera was returned. Mainly, the lack of reliability having the camera cut out in the middle of the night waking us up several times, the beeping when buttons were pressed, and the frozen picture issues. It seems like Motorola quickly launched a product that simply wasn<U+2019>t ready to be launched."
"2877","4","This is a complete system that does not require a computer/phone, but will also let you stream video and interact via iOS which is pretty cool.The camera is pretty small and has a very broad pan and tilt range, so it should work pretty much anywhere you can place it on a high enough vantage point.The remote and the camera are powered using the same micro-USB power charger (it comes with one for each). The remote is rechargeable so you can take it anywhere within WiFi range, and beyond that you can use your iOS device wherever you are.The remote display has a fold up antenna (usually seems to work fine without it folded out), and a metal stand tab that folds out from the back to prop it up.Overall the quality feels very good, though not as absolutely rock-solid as one might expect from the Motorola brand historically. The display interface is touch-based and can be a little fiddly. It's got a completely proprietary user interface so it takes a few minutes to get the hang of it, but you can pretty much figure it out by messing around with it. Volume of audio in both directions is adequate, but not booming.If you don't have the remote turned off completely it starts beeping if it loses the signal from the camera.There's a micro-SD card you can record to, but the process to do so is a little fiddly going through the menus.You can (in theory) buy a second camera to work with the system so you can monitor two locations without relocating the camera.Overall the video quality is excellent and the night-vision works well. The pan/tilt response is rather typically laggy and sometimes moves more than you'd like but generally it's quite controllable and lets you get it pointed where you want without too much trouble.There seems to be no provision for an earphone/headphone.If you want an expandable all-in-one monitor this one seems to be about as fully featured as you can get. Might be a little overwhelming for grandma to operate though.4.5 stars.G."
"2878","1","Echoing the other bad reviews. Adding that the charger design is so flawed because it so heavy and flimsy that the charger just constantly falls out of the monitor with even the slightest touch. And it does not last through the night if it is not plugged in.Also, camera dropped from about 1 foot off the floor and screen totally destroyed. Speaks to the cheap construction that is pretty evident from all other reviews.It irritates me that this crappy product is out there. Motorola please stop."
"2879","1","The cameras are horrible, from responsiveness, to resolution to lag to firmware updating nightmares... the monitor is absolute garbage, but the worst part?  The Hubble app is suicide inducing."
"2880","1","This monitor doesn't have a very good night vision and that's when you use a baby monitor most frequently. Also I hate how the Motorola outlet adapter comes out of its socket so easily. And the app that's compatible with your iPhone works whenever it feels like it. I would have bought a cheaper monitor if I knew what poor quality this product offers."
"2881","2","The camera is not reliable and doesn't work well all the time. The camera is connected to a charger which bends and doesn't connect very well Often time the camera has major connectivity problems. I have twin babies of 18 months and Im getting really fed up with this camera.  There is some heavy tube on the connector line that makes it very difficult to use on the side of the crib or if attached to the wall. Its weigh seems to pull the connector out of the socket therefore constantly creating problems with connection.  I spent so much money on these 2 cameras and monitor that I'm really angry that the manufacture only has a 1 year warranty for this problem."
"2882","4","Although promoted as a baby monitor, this device has multiple potential uses. When combined with the iPhone app, you will be automatically alerted when the camera detects movement, when the mic detects sound, or when the temperature has fallen too low. As a result, this is a wonderful home monitor. You'll know if the heat fails, if your home phone rings, or if someone walks through the room occupied by the camera. If you leave notifications turned on with your iPhone, you'll be alerted under any of those circumstances; you can then activate the app and view the current image as well as listen to the sound which the mic picked up.I found the app to be slightly buggy and ran into the following issues: at one point, while gone for the day, the system decided it was time to upgrade the firmware in the camera. The restart did not go smoothly and required me to re-pair the device in person, so the system was off-line for a period of time during my absence. I also found that from time to time, if I am regularly accessing the image/sound from my iPhone, the pairing of the supplied monitor is sometimes lost and that too needs to be re-paired with the camera. Largely, though, the entire system works well, is well constructed, and provides a very reasonable service. The wifi connection is smooth and has only a slight delay, and the camera can be pivoted remotely from the iPhone over most high speed network or wifi connections. The IR LEDs are invisible to the human eye yet provide excellent monochrome night vision.The system includes all required items, including the camera/mic/speaker assembly, the remote monitor, AC cords and plugs for both units, and a complete instruction manual with directions as to how to install the iPhone app. The Hubble website contains additional support and provides further information on the app."
"2883","2","Let me first say I had the Motorola MPB36 with one camera for my first daughter. I used it for 3 years but by year two it was on it's way out mostly due to the fact my daughter dropped the camera about 100 times. Besides that I was very happy with it. So when I was first looking for a new monitor with two cameras for my impending baby girl I figured I would get another motorola. I bought this one at target on clearance but was so unhappy with it I needed to write a review on amazon.Biggest Cons:- Touch screen is horrible; it freezes often, anytime you press a button it makes a loud beeping that you can't turn off or down and it drove my husband crazy.- Volume is VERY low even at the loudest level- Clock Display; I was so happy to see this with the new monitor cause it was annoying to wake up in the middle of the night and not know what time it was without digging around for my cell phone. However, once I initially set up the clock I realized that when I turned off the monitor and then turned it back off the time was suddenly off. I set it again and again the same thing happened. This probably happened 4 times before I realized it was definitley not me and that for some reason the time was keeping when I turned it off.- Sound Delay - had a good 4 second sound delay which isn't a big deal but it wasn't very assuring and pretty annoying to hear your kid faintly yelling or crying from the other room and then hearing it echo in the monitor a few seconds later.Pros- Good screen resolution- Nice extra features like temp and clock (if it worked correctly)- In theory having the app connect to it so you can monitor from your phone is probably great but I didn't even bother because of all those other negatives."
"2884","3","Purchased this monitor for our baby that was due in January of this year. So we have only been using it for about 6 months. The positives: clear picture, easy to use. The negatives: power button only works half of the time, cameras have to be plugged in so the cords look junky hanging down the wall. My main gripe is the power button issue. I'm currently trying to get it to turn on (fully charged) and it's as if the monitor is dead. Very frustrating. We paid quite a bit for this monitor (purchased at Buy Buy Baby) and for it not to turn on half the time is disappointing."
"2885","1","It makes me sick to think we spent so much money on this piece of trash. The camera is unreliable at best. The pan/tilt delay is ridiculous. You could wait up to a minute for the thing to respond. Then there's the connection... at first, it would lose connection once a week. Then it started randomly shutting off multiple times a week. Then daily. We used the music presets on this camera, which meant that several times during any given day, the music would shut off after 30 seconds, 5 minutes, or even 20 minutes. Now the stupid thing won't even turn on. I've been going back and forth with tech support for 2 months (they only offer support through email, so be prepared for a very long and drawn out process!)... so infuriating."
"2886","1","The camera beeps in the middle of the night waking up my baby!!  DO NOT BUY THIS MONITOR!!I was never able to pair my phone with the camera.  Other than that the monitor and camera worked great for about 3 months.  All the sudden the camera started to turn off randomly or beep loudly in the middle of the night waking up my child.  I never once moved it from the wall where we first mounted it.  It was never damaged in anyway.  Now every night it beeps so loud, waking my child that I decided to not use it anymore and to get another brand."
"2887","1","Should be 0/5 stars.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE.  Don't waste your time or money.  Fails to setup and customer service has no idea how to trouble shoot or help.  Tried 3 different units of the same model, every single one of them was defective.  Absolutely awful.  Never recommend it."
"2888","1","The functionality of the product is good, however, our monitor quit working after a couple of months.  After attempting for a month to get Motorola to assist, I've given up on Motorola and purchased a monitor from a different company.  Motorola's customer service is terrible.  They made several promises both in e-mail and over the phone (reps and managers) to get back to me and replace the product, but I never hear back from them.  Given the price of this product, you would expect much better customer service when one of their products breaks on a consumer."
"2889","1","This system has tons of bugs.  Constantly drops signal, audio doesn't always come on through the monitor, picture quality is not good, volume level is not loud enough through the monitor, and all in all it just not reliable which is not a good quality for a baby monitor.  I find myself waking up just to make sure the monitor is still working and has not dropped the feed."
"2890","1","This monitor doesn't even deserve the one star I had to give it. It was great at first and the set up was not hard. After a few months we started to have a lot of issues with it and had to have it replaced. Now after 18 months, we are on our fifth one. Both the monitor and the camera have been replaced For the same issues over and over.  Motorola is awful to their customers and have been such a hassle to deal with. I will never buy anything from them again."
"2891","1","1. The camera randomly beeps in my daughters room for no apparent reason. Even when the monitor portion is off and the camera is plugged in.2. I've had to mount the camera on the wall (this is not a problem) but in order to see the whole crib I have to mount it far enough away that I can hardly see the baby..the picture quality is terrible.3. I have to keep it plugged in at night because the battery life is not long enough to stay on all night even fully charged so then it just randomly lights up and turns on even when the baby isn't making noise or moving, the light then wakes me up.NOT WORTH THE $$$"
"2892","1","If i could give this zero stars I would. I have the older version and its 100 times better. You cannot see anything at night on this monitor. Im staring at a grainy black screen. The volume is also not very good unless the baby is crying and you have the monitor next to you, you will not hear it.  So disappointed what a waste. Returning it tomorrow."
"2893","1","This is the worse monitor ever.  It always stops working in the middle of the night so hopefully you can hear your baby screaming even without a monitor, otherwise scream away they will until you awaken on your own.  They constantly send emails that they are updating their system or whatever BS to explain why their monitor never works. Hubble is the wifi system and it is horrible.  I spent a lot of money and I am asking them for a refund.  Either way.  Do not buy this monitor if you actually want to hear your baby at night."
"2894","5","This baby monitor is extremely easy to use! The camera is amazing. I love the color screen and the ability to see my baby in the dark during nighttime. The night vision is very clear. You can move the camera around if baby moves in the crib (our baby is always moving from one end of the crib to the other). The app is great too if you want to check in while out on a date night! I like how the colored dots on the top of the screen monitor the strength of baby's crying. If baby is just making noise it is green and when baby is really upset it goes to red. I don't like to have the volume on when we are watching tv so this is a great feature to monitor how baby is doing. I like how the monitor tells you the temperature in the room. Lastly, we will turn the music feature on in the morning when baby is waking up and playing in her crib and we want a few more minutes in bed! Great monitor - no complaints!"
"2895","1","This thing is terrible.  I've had another Motorola monitor which lasted for 2 years until the camera died.  It's as if this product is not even made by the same company.  I've had this product for a day and have had it set up for only about an hour (I let the camera and parent unit charge the recommended 16 hours) and it has already malfunctioned. The parent unit is froze on the start screen for several minutes and now the picture is mostly yellow, even after restarting the camera and parent unit.  I'm not sure if mine is defective, but based on other negative reviews I'm guessing that this is just not a good product.  Returning it ASAP."
"2896","1","I can<U+2019>t begin to tell you how disappointed I have been with this monitor. Within a month of use, the charger stopped charging and we had to wait a week to get a new cord. Now, 6 months in, the sound on the monitor just decided to stop working. Since they had sent a replacement a couple months ago, I pulled that out to connect it to the camera. 20 minutes later and lots of stress later, I<U+2019>ve got it connected. But they didn<U+2019>t include a battery, so it has to always be plugged in.Save yourself the major hassle and frustration and look elsewhere!!"
"2897","2","We bought this as it's one of the few solutions out there that has its own small monitor for around the house and we can also access online away from home via an app. You'd think there would be more like it, not that I could find.Anyway, camEra is ok. Daylight and night vision averge at best. The remote controls are nice if the camera view needs to be adjusted.The sound is terrible compared to almost every other monitor. Very hard to hear unless your kid is at a full cry or talking really loud.Again, the only reason we keep this is because it's a one camera solution for our baby monitor. Away from home we can use the app. While at home we can use the included monitor. We also bought a second camera to watch our other young one."
"2898","5","This monitor has been amazing! I love that I can see what is going on with my baby's care from anywhere in the world. It allows me to not only keep track of my baby but of my nanny as well. The temperature feature is extremely helpful in helping me decide how warm or light to dress my little guy at night since overheating is a major cause of SIDS. The picture is clear - night vision included - and the monitor is very easy to use. I have recommended it to at least 3 friends and they are all happy with theirs. It is compact enough that it's easy to travel with and has worked well in several of our family's and friend's homes as well when we have stayed overnight."
"2899","2","When it works, it works great. But it rarely seems to work like it should (especially with the Hubble app-connectivity issues galore-even with great internet access!). It also seems like we<U+2019>re constantly having to charge the monitor. Every now and then, the camera will beep (loudly) in our baby<U+2019>s room. This usually happens when the connection between the camera and monitor is somehow interrupted (no idea how that happens!). It would be the PERFECT set up if they could just work out all the kinks..."
"2900","5","took a chance despite negative reviews bc it had the feautures i wanted. we love it and it fits our needs.edited:  still working great 08/2016!"
"2901","1","I bought this at babies r us. It said, ""don't return to the store"" so I faithfully exchanged it through Motorola 5 times until I got one that almost worked. Now, a year later, the cord will not stay in, so it will not charge. Other problems I've had include: no video, intermittently there is no sound, plug problems, etc. so frustrated."
"2902","1","There are so many things that are wrong with this product. First the night vision is terrible. Can barely see anything on the screen. The controls to move the camera are so hard to use, if you want to move the camera a little bit its practically impossible. It picks up sound very well and the video in the day is great but we need it at night time. Then last night it just stopped working and took an hour to get it back on. I will be buying a different monitor just so I don't have to deal with the stress of this company. Such a waste of money."
"2903","5","Ok so the last baby monitor we had was black and white and had constant static.  Baby monitors have come a long way over the last 10 years and this one is state of the art. I am just shocked at how clear the picture is and how well it works. It was so easy to connect and the picture is such a godsend. To be able to see if my little one is just being fussy or needs some serious adult intervention. I love to be able to interact too by talking through the monitor. In addition, the night vision works pretty well. Anytime I wake up I can take a peek without disturbing him. I also downloaded the app and can now view him anytime through my iphone. It is real peace of mind. I am so happy with this I cant stand it. Yes I know that sounds lame, but with a newborn who sleeps 2 hours at the most this monitor has been truly helpful to me."
"2904","1","This is by far the single worst piece of technology I've ever purchased. My wife and I have had to return it to the store for replacement four times. The first time the screen just went black and never came back on. The second time one of the arrow buttons on the monitor display was broken and behaved like it was being continually pressed. The third time the monitor screen would only stay on if it was plugged in as if it had no battery life. The most recent time audio would work in viewing through the camera over the web app worked, but the monitor display that came with it showed no camera available. I can't believe that this product doesn't have all one star reviews. It's literally the biggest piece of crap with the biggest price tag of anything electronic we purchased since having the baby."
"2905","1","Where do I begin? I hate this camera system. It constantly loses signal, charging only worked for the first few months, the app rarely connects properly, the temperature is always wrong, the speakers make the preloaded songs sound awful (doing the opposite of lulling my child to sleep), the buttons stopped working for an entire week, and I could go on. Unfortunately, the silver lining in this whole mess is the fact that My wife and I didn<U+2019>t buy it ourselves. It was a baby shower gift. Do not buy it!"
"2906","5","This is the second baby monitor I have had and this one is the best one so far.It has lots of features that are really nice.It can be used with the included monitor or you can download an app and use your phone or tablet to keep an eye on your little one.The camera can be panned up and down and side to side and has two way communication so if the baby awakens you can talk to them.It plays music also and there are adjustments for volume,camera brightness and a few others.The camera has pretty good image quality and is more than acceptable.In the box you get the camera and two power packs plus the monitor and instructions.Some have had issues with the camera but so far this one seems fine.I was able to setup the camera without using the instructions and most people should be able to do so also.I really like this camera and could not be happier with it."
"2907","1","I have had this product for our daughter for 1.5 years.  The parent unit (monitor) stopped working after this short time. I have emailed Motorola customer service, but since the product is outside of the 1 year warranty, they are going to charge $125 to replace the product.  I would recommend you find a product that works the same way but with a better warranty and better customer service.  I would NEVER recommend this product and I will be doing research to find something to replace this baby monitor."
"2908","1","Almost comically awful. Pan feature moves so slowly we couldn't find our tantruming child as he ran around his room. Of course we bought this horrible video monitor the week he transitioned to a big boy bed so the failure of the pan feature was super critical. The light on the camera was so bright it kept out child up, and the resolution was impacted dramatically - much grainier and choppier than the image on our originalMotorola. We exchanged this for our beloved original no wifi Motorola, and are happy with our choice."
"2909","2","No idea that these cameras would keep us awake! Loss connection is a sad noise that keeps a mother and father of twins up at night for no reason. For no reason the internet app shows my lines instead of my babies. The monitor shows them on a plus side.  Like Insaid before when the cam losses signal (a lot) it makes a terrible noise that can wake the dead or parents. Got two stars only because Motorola gave us a replacement monitor for free when the originals speaker died."
"2910","1","I got this camera when my son turned 6 months old and started sleeping in his own room. I loved it a first; I could peek at him anytime I wanted in the middle of the night without disturbing any other sleeper in the house.One day it started acting up. The monitor turning m off all of a sudden on its own with a full battery even when it was plugged in. We unplugged and reset the camera, checked for updates, etc. The problems just continued to get worse and worse. The camera froze one night and while I thought my son was sleeping peacefully he was wide awake and crying. (I cannot hear him from my room without a monitor.) That was the last straw.I contacted customer services via email because for whatever reason their phone lines were busy. I spent 2 weeks, one email each day, because that was all the person I was talking to would email me, trouble shooting the problem. Many of which I already tried. After trying everything we could the representative decided that the camera was not working correctly and would need to be replaced. The representative gave me contact info to get the replacement started. I sent my camera in for replacement and waited a month before calling to see why the replacement hasn't come yet. Turns out the information saying they received the old, broken camera was not entered into the system. They found that information and said they would send it out right away. 2, almost 3, weeks later still no camera. Called customer service again. This time they don't have all my contact information in their computer system. I'm beyond upset at this point. I give them my information yet again and explain how disappointed I am that I spent all this money and I'm not even getting my money's worth out of it. I realize things don't work magically and they break, but I'd at least expect a problem to be promptly fixed or a replacement to be sent out immediately. I'd like to talk to a supervisor but apparently they're all ""busy"". When is enough, enough?! I bought the camera for peace of mind, but now it's causing so much trouble. At this point I just want to get my money back so and get a video monitor from a different company."
"2911","5","I am sure this makes a great baby monitor, but we actually used it for something different. We incorporated it into a robot my kids were building and made the best spy bot ever created! The fact that it worked so well for snooping around the house and letting the kids go on some amazing adventures leads me to believe this would work perfectly as a baby monitor as well.The good thing is now you know once the baby is a bit older, there will be other uses for the monitor. So, keep it around and add it easily with duct tape and lots of imagination to pro-bots, Mindstorms (it is heavy, so it won't move fast - but it does work). You can also add it to large toy firetrucks and it even makes a good news truck for kids to do reporting from. Honestly - we have been having quite a bit of fun."
"2912","1","Had this monitor for all of 6 WEEKS when the video started failing. The sound broke shortly after and the power cable to the handheld monitor had frayed and broken by three months. Not to mention that the wifi app was often down as well.This is, hands down, the worst quality item I have ever purchased. Charging $200+ dollars for this piece of garbage is criminal.On top of all this, Motorola told me I needed to pay the shipping costs if I wanted a new one they only pay shipping on the ""second return"". Brought it back to the store and bought something else. I am truly appalled at how awful this product and the customer service are."
"2913","1","This monitor is terrible!! The parent unit loses it's charge very quickly (we've resorted to just keeping it plugged in most of the time) and I continually have to reset the clock. The picture often freezes up and shows an old image for 2-3 minutes. The mobile app often doesn't work. The volume is too low, even when turned all the way up. The camera controls often malfunction and make the camera go up when you want it to go down. The movement of the camera is NOT silent so it will wake baby. The camera does not have a great range and you have to play around to position it. We have to prop ours up with a folded up diaper so that it will show baby laying in the crib. Overall, I am VERY UNHAPPY with this monitor. I would return it but it was a gift and we're past the return date at Babies R Us. :-/"
"2914","1","I absolutely HATE this monitor!!! Making sure your baby  is safe at night and safe with other people is top priority. This camera is not reliable. It automatically shuts off and starts beeping in the middle of the night and there<U+2019>s nothing to do but to shut it off and have no way to see your baby. Not ok! There is also time lapse when watching with both the monitor and the phone. I wanted a reliable camera so I can check in while at work on my baby, I wish I chose a different one."
"2915","3","Definitely not worth the $250 that it was originally advertised as.  Seems like recent prices are more commensurate with average performance of unit.Pros:Allows for dual viewing via Wifi and handheldGood range on the handheldCons:Horrible and frustrating interface on the handheld unit.1-2 second delay in reacting to pan/tilt commandsOnly HD via Hubble app, which is also frustratingly slow"
"2916","2","I am on my 2nd monitor in 2 months! First one audio quit spontaneously, 2nd video feed freezes constantly and screen comes on bright spontaneously during the night, lighting up entire room! I think the speaker is very small and it's on the backside so you don't get great sound unless it is completely quiet around you! You cannot turn off the sound to the buttons being pressed which is annoying in the middle of the night because it is so noisy to other people trying to sleep! It does NOT zoom in as much as other monitors I've seen, only 2x which is not enough to see close ups!"
"2917","1","We bought this product after the first baby monitor broke.  It's so hard to find a good monitor!  For the price expected more!  We had trouble setting up the app, the camera kept dropping off.  Disconnected from base in the middle of the night.  The night vision is HORRIBLE, you can barely see the baby in the crib (what's the point).  The blue flashing light on the camera is annoying and my baby was staring at it until he finally went to sleep.  The kickstand on the parent monitor is very flimsy, it keeps falling over.I was really excited about the app functionality, but it was an overall disappointment.  Oh and we've only had it one day!"
"2918","1","The monitor fails to charge after a few months and the cell phone app works 50% of the time. I<U+2019>ve received 3 replacements and the company is just waiting for the warranty to expire. Avoid all Motorola products to spare you the disappointment. If you love your children, pick a better monitor."
"2919","3","When it works it's great. And I do like that I can use the app on my phone as well. At first the app hardly worked but once the app was updated I've had few issues. I'm bow actually having more luck with the app than the actual monitor. I can't get it to stay connected. I'm currently on my second one as motorola had to send me a new one because the first one didn't work. Overall not the best purchase."
"2920","1","I wanted to like this monitor, but have been disappointed. I read reviews and got it as gift. The power cord to the camera will not stay in and we had to tape it in order for it to work. Now just a year after having it (no longer under warranty), the sound has gone out on the parent unit along with the little lights that tell you the ""intensity"" of the nose in the room. We have had constant issues with the video going in and out and disconnecting from the camera. I would not recommend this product to potential buyers."
"2921","1","MOTOROLA Worst company to buy a camera from so pricey and poor quality! it will break within one year! And they are very bad at helping u replace it!"
"2922","1","I have had this for about 8 months now. It worked fine for about 3 months, but has steadily become worse. The image, day or night, is not even poor quality. It looks like the grainy corner store security cameras from the 90s.When we first turned on the monitor you could see our child breathing, now he blends in with the surrounding blurry blobs that are in fact his blanket.I have replaced this with a Samsung Wisenet (SEW-3053W).  Peace of mind restored."
"2923","2","The charging port is very flimsy on this unit, and it has now stopped charging.  The poor design of the female adaptor port really hurts an otherwise decent monitor.  The camera works without issue, but that's not much good if the monitor stops charging.  Now I need to buy a new camera/monitor system (likely not another Motorola) since you can't just buy a single monitor replacement."
"2924","2","While it was working (2 weeks) it was great!  Picture and audio were very good as far as I was concerned.  It failed one night for some reason and after all the different efforts it never would regain the pairing and image.  The tech support was pretty helpful and finally offered to replace it.  But then they informed me that I had to pay for the return of the defective unit.  That irritates me and is enough to make me avoid Motorola (branded, not manufactured by the way) in the future."
"2925","2","I would not recommend this product.  My first one lasted almost 7 days then the screen would freeze.  When I tried to check it from my smart phone it was not hard to see and at times would only show part of the picture.  I sent that back receiving another  (I was hoping it was just that one) this time I didn't connect it to the WIFI hoping that would fix the problem.  The 2nd one lasted about 3 weeks then did the same exact thing.  I decided to go with a  Motorola MBP 43.  I have had no problems with that.  It doesn't connect to WIFI but then what I'm reading about people hacking into your baby monitor and looking at your baby or toddler scares me.  I did give it 2 stars as amazon did send me the replacement quickly.  They sent it befire they recieved the 1st one."
"2926","1","Got this terrible product made by an even worse corporation less than a year ago and it stopped working 4 months in. Spoke with Motorola's  technical support and told them the situation and they offered a ""discount"" to purchase the item from them again! Avoid this monitor like the plague if you want something that works for your family. But if decide not to heed my warning, you'll have to deal with really crummy service reps. Buyer beware!!!"
"2927","3","The camera comes paired with the included monitor. It sets up quickly and works relatively well with the included monitor. Resolution with the included monitor is low but acceptable for use as a baby monitor. The two way intercom feature works okay with the included monitor. You can add 3 additional cameras for a total of 4. Pairing a camera is as simple. If you have ever paired a bluetooth headset to your phone, the steps are pretty much the same. The monitor has a volume control on top to increase or decrease volume but even at max, it is rather weak and tinny. You can turn off the monitor and leave audio on to conserve battery. The setup comes with 2 micro USB adapters. One powers the camera and the other powers/charges the monitor. They are interchangeable and you can also use your cell phone charger as long as it supplies at least 1500mA. Camera can be panned left-right and tilted up-down. There is no automatic scanning that I could find. You can program the monitor to turn off the screen after 5, 30 or 60 min. to save power or you can leave it on continuously. It stays on continuously anyway if plugged in. It has IR illumination so it can see in total darkness. The monitor can accept a micro SD card for storage. The manual does not tell you how large a card it will accept but I tried a 16GB card and it recognized it. I'm not sure what I am doing wrong but I could not get it to record. When I tried to play back a recording, the monitor would just lock up until I pressed the menu button. Update: The 16GB card was too big. When I removed it and installed a 2GB card, the record/playback function works. I'm not sure how long you can record as it doesn't tell you. So I'm not sure the max size card but 2GB works and 16GB does not.I downloaded the Android app and paired the camera to my router. That was also pretty easy. The Android app guides you through the process. Even with a fast WiFi connection, performance degraded significantly. There was a long delay in video and it was choppy. Microphone did not work reliably. Controlling the camera was difficult because of the delay. You must press the pan button and then wait several seconds because otherwise, you will overshoot due to the delay. This was just on my home WiFi not over the Internet! I can stream 1080p movies with no problem so it is not my network. Next I tried it over the Internet using my 4G LTE phone. Performance was similar to my home WiFi.I tried using the web portal to view/control the camera but I could not connect. I'm not sure if it is down or what but I got a message saying it was transferring data but never even got to a login screen.So if you plan to use this strictly as a baby monitor with the included camera, it works okay. If you plan to use it as an IP camera over WiFi or the Internet, you will likely be disappointed."
"2928","1","This is the worst camera I have ever owned. The first camera phone was clearer then this. Dont even get me started on customer service. I have had a problem with this camera for over a month and they are stringing me along with ""we are trying to find the problem"". I would never recommend this product, as it is more of a hazard to watch your kid on it then to have no camera at all."
"2929","1","Purchased this monitor a year ago and since almost day 1 the power cords have fallen out with the slightest movement.  Nothing more annoying than going to check on your baby in the middle of the night to find your monitor screen dead because you nudged it and the power cord came out.The camera is slow and hardly works with the app.  Don't waste your money"
"2930","2","I can't hear a thing! I have the volume turned all the way up and the white noise machine going next to my sleeping baby, but I can't hear it without having to put my ear up to the speaker. This is NOT comforting when I move her from my room to her own room.I the picture quality does the work but it freezes and has to reload to the new image. The battery does not hold up well loses two bars, if you want to have the video on the entire nap time (2-3 hours).I will be keeping this for now but will probably get a new one when we move her to her own room. I don't want to have to wait till she's screaming to go check on her."
"2931","1","This is the worst (and one of the most expensive) products I got when having my first baby. The WiFi is crap, the screen freezes constantly, the battery life is short, the clock on the screen is never correct despite resetting, and intermittently the camera just stops working. Today, after having it for less than 2 years, the charger stopped working. HORRIBLE!"
"2932","1","Horrible piece of equipment, as expected from this prevalent baby monitor brand. I feel like this is the baby monitor provided to a citizen of the Soviet Union. All vocal and video is delayed. Want to move the camera to find your baby? Try hitting the move button like 15 times before you get a response. Want to see your baby? Try hoping that the camera works that night! Maybe I have a lemon?A piece of junk. Buy this product and you will surely be out of your money while you put it in for the return. If anyone has one of these that works well, what luck you must have. The other half of us are wondering how they are going to cover the money while we wait for a replacement to ship!DO NOT BUY. PIECE OF JUNK."
"2933","1","I'll go on record as saying I have never posted a review on a product before but this one had me so outraged I had to let anyone know who is considering buying this monitor .  Now let me tell you that I don't know how there's a single positive review on this monitor because between the store I bought it from and the Motorola company itself, I have had my hands on at least five different sets of this exact monitor all of which had the exact same defects, some worse than others .""Volume level indicator"" does not work on any of the 5 I had. meaning that when your baby makes a sound, there is no lights to indicate that there is a sound so you had better plan on really listening hard if you have a TV or anything on in the house because you will not ""see"" that there was noise coming from your babies room . At 3 AM it will claim the camera is out of range.  Not possible since I'm only two bedrooms away .  Then it makes a nice long loud beeping sound to indicate the camera is out of range, it also does this when the battery is low which is basically anytime you have it unplugged for longer than a couple of hours  Don't even think of listening to this monitor without it being plugged in overnight for sleeping or you will be awoken by the same beeping noise .  Coincidently as I'm writing this review the monitor is beeping that it is out of range when it is maybe 15 feet from the camera, in the living room just outside of our sons door . I just had an incident where for a solid hour, there was zero sound coming out of the monitor. So I could see my son but  no sound, not even when I went into his room and started testing ""hello, hello"" was the monitor picking up any sound. What a huge waste of money. This company should not be making baby monitors .  I believe that anyone who has written a positive review must have this monitor confused with one of the other many models that Motorola makes as they all do look very similar however I will tell you, two times I sent this monitor back to Motorola and twice did I bring it back to the store totaling five different monitors of this model number all completely defective .  I will be returning this to the store and buying a completely different brand . Don't waste your money or time, I am the queen of research and should have listened to the others."
"2934","1","Monitor was good, and camera features are great...however the metal components that went into the monitor and camera to charge (jack, etc) were cheap beyond words. If you moved the monitor where the wire bent ever so slightly then the metal component also bent and would no longer interlock into the monitor/camera. The 3rd time I took this back to babies r us the nice manager said that she was aware of an issue with the charging ports. Today I returned this piece of pool for the last time. Also...do yourself s favor....unless you have total strangers watching your kid I'd toy hate/ mistrust that person immensely...then you don't need WIFI. No need to stalk my parents or hub us sister."
"2935","1","Third baby monitor, for third baby, and by far the most frustrating I've ever used. Touch screen is non responsive half of the time, the charging cords are so heavy that they fall out of both the camera and the monitor. Have to turn the camera off and on every time I want to use it, after which it emits a huge BEEP, effectively waking the baby. This is definitely one of those times when cost is not equivalent to quality."
"2936","4","I didn't get this for its primary purpose as we don't have children. Given its features, this monitor can be used for much more than just as a baby monitor. Because it connects to your wi-fi network, you can use the camera to keep an eye on any area you need, whether it is to keep an eye on your pets while at work or a particular room in your home. It comes with a paired ""parent unit"" with rechargeable battery, but you can also link to your iPhone, iPad or Andriod device with an app that helps you set up the system and gives you remote access. The base unit and parent unit are powered by included micro USB chargers (wonder if you could use for other devices?) and there is a micro SD slot in the parent unit for recording."
"2937","1","This camera broke one day after we had used it for about 1 month and Motorola refused to help because we bought it more than a year ago (purchased during our last pregnancy for our baby that we lost). It was fairly difficult to operate even when it did work.Simple things on the monitor never worked like the time (you can set it to the correct time, and it will pick a random time to display next time you turn it on)."
"2938","5","Is it pricey? yes! Is it awesome? YES!I searched high and low for a monitor that would fulfill all the wants and needs my husband and I wanted in a baby monitor.  We thought about going the route of no separate handheld monitor unit and just getting a wi-fi based camera and use our phones.  But I didn't want to rely 100% on the battery life of my phone plus I wanted the versatility of having something for a sitter without having to share a password with them.  I also really wanted the opportunity for my husband to check in on baby while at work or while a sitter was at the house.  So this monitor fit the bill for all things needed/wanted as well as being a highly recommended brand name.  So even though I could have purchased a much cheaper option, I splurged for this one.  And I am glad I did!We haven't used all of the features yet but it works like a charm so far.  We've only had it set up for about a week to test it out before our little one arrives.  My husband has the app set up on his phone and gets notified when there are movements and sounds detected in the nursery (and has been working quite well as a doggie cam so far!).  I've been at home when he's logged into the camera and panned/tilted/zoomed it all around and tested out the music and talk back features (which he startled me with by yelling ""hey what are you doing?"" randomly while I was in the nursery putting things away HA!).  The handheld unit has a super large display so it's easy to see everything.  The night vision seems to be pretty good as well.  For everything we've used it for so far it seems great!  I can't wait to get an additional camera, once they are available, to add to the system for additional room coverage/doggie cam/home security.So overall I would recommend this monitor for some one who is looking for all the bells and whistles on a monitor.  I don't think there is a comparable unit out there at the moment."
"2939","2","Without a doubt the biggest waste of money out of everything we bought to prepare for baby. The charger that comes with it fits looks, making it nearly impossible to keep charging unless you can tilt it ever so perfectly. It also doesn't have good zoom features, you can't change the music volumes, the charge does not last long. Sometimes when we turn the sound on in the baby's room, it just stops working. Wish I had known and we definitely would've purchased a different one."
"2940","2","Video quality is grainy and delayed. Monitor just stopped working, won<U+2019>t charge or turn on. Worked last night fine. Baby is 11 months, so didn<U+2019>t quite make it a full year. Phone app often doesn<U+2019>t find the monitor and. I have to resync the app."
"2941","1","The camera never works. I thought it was the internet bC I was using my phone but it always says offline even if I'm using the monitor it came with. I had internet tested and nothing there. Contacted company and heard nothing back."
"2942","4","It was a gift I bought for someone.  They are just now going to get some use out of it with their new bundle of joy.  So far, it works great.  They are able to use their smart phone to see the visual,  they can hear, and also it has a speaker."
"2943","1","This worked fine for 7 months. Then stopped working. Despite Motorola<U+2019>s support website promise of a response within 8 hours, we are still waiting for one 24 hours later. This is too expensive to just quit working."
"2944","1","If I could give this camera zero stars, I would. We purchased this in Aug 2016, it worked for roughly 3 days. Motorola is great to work with, but you have to wait weeks for a replacement, therefore having no way to (ding ding ding) monitor your baby(ies). The app doesn't work, which is one of the main reasons we purchased this camera bc my spouse travels a lot for work & wanted to be able to see the babies remotely.Save your time and money & purchase something different. We are definitely kicking ourselves."
"2945","1","This is our second motorola monitor and I am so disappointed because our first one lasted 3 years. The monitor randomly disconnects from the camera, this only happens when the baby is asleep in her room (as that is the time when need to use it). You need to push a button on the camera to reconnect, meaning you have to go into sleeping baby room to do this. The night vision doesn't work, all I can see is a black screen."
"2946","4","The monitor does the basics, provides sound, shows you what is going on and has an app that connects to everything. The down side is that it beeps occasionally to tell me it is too hot or cold in the room when it is not, panning the room takes a long time and the app is glitchy. Also, the device's screen locks within a few seconds. This may not seem like a big deal but in the middle of the night when you turn the screen on to check on baby and have to press s million buttons to get the screen to go off it is."
"2947","2","BUYER BEWARE ONLY COVERED ONE YEAR: After one year, Motorola expects you to start all over and purchase another system if there's even a slight problem. You might as well spend less and get something else. If you're just going to have to come out of your pocket again when it stops working in two years, save the money. Motorola rethink customer service. Loyalty lost here."
"2948","4","We love ours. We mostly use it for our baby but we just went out town for the weekend. We decided to set it up in our kitchen more so just to see how it worked while we traveled. We had two people whom we trust very much taking care of our of dogs. It was fun checking in on our dogs. We are now purchasing two more cameras."
"2949","1","Daytime camera is good, night time infrared is horrible can't see much.  Sound monitoring is pretty bad,  can't hear him ever!  Control to pan are flaky.  Wouldn't suggest this to anyone.  I also have the Logitech circle,  can't pan but can zoom,  and the field of view is pretty wide.  Also it dosent have a separate monito,  so I have to use my phone or iPad.  Still way better than the motorola."
"2950","4","Setting up the two cameras to the monitor was very simple, pretty much just turned them on and there they were.  The monitor image quality isn't amazing but it is acceptable for what is needed.  All the features are great, the interface is pretty simple to understand.I did have some issues connecting the cameras to the Hubble app.  I ended up having to restart my iPhone and both cameras a few times to get them to connect.  Once connected everything was fine, although there is a good deal of latency on the image and app controls (could just be the network that I'm on, but I did an internet speed test and it said I was pulling 20mbs download speeds).All in all, everything seems to be as advertised and should work great for when our first baby gets here in a few weeks!!"
"2951","1","I am extremely disappointed in this monitor. The sound on the parent unit is so low that I can not hear my baby when she cries! I have considered ordering a $20 audio only monitor to go along with this just so I can hear her, however it would interfere from what I understand. The night vision is ok, but it takes forever to link the camera to the parent unit. Huge delays. My husband and I both use the ap on our phones and it constantly goes out and freezes. I no longer have the box or a receipt for this item as it was a gift, but I plan to call Motorola. I think something from a garage sale would work better."
"2952","1","Cannot get the WIFI portion to work and Tech Support cannot seem to assist with troubleshooting.  It says there is an ""unprintable character"" in the SSID but it is a simple work with no spaces.  Netgear router has never had any issues connecting to anything else.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  Figured out that this unit will only work with specific Wifi routers.  The unit only worked for about 90 days and the main unit and camera disconnected and we cannot get it to reconnect following all troubleshooting ... We will buy a basic wifi camera system since Motorola cannot seem to get this right!"
"2953","1","This is a miserable product. Run far away from this baby monitor. Would give 0 stars if possible.- I have stopped even attempting to use the Hubble app to watch the camera from my phone. Did not work from day one.- Power cord fits very loose in monitor unit and falls on on its own. I have learned to position everything so that it stays plugged in.- Constantly loses connection from camera and INCESSANTLY beeps in the middle of the night.- Camera controls never work"
"2954","1","We have had this monitor for less than two months and the sound has gone out four times now .  This has caused us to unintentionally ignore a screaming infant because we couldn't hear him which has made me feel horrible.  I have called their warrantee information line and they are sending me a replacement for the monitor piece not the camera so I am curious to see if the sound problem will be fixed."
"2955","1","Our previous Motorola dual camera system died after 5 years.  We loved it.  I purchased this model because I liked the idea of being able to log in from work.  It took some time with tech support to get the cameras recognized but for me the hubble app worked great.  However, the rest of the camera system is nothing but awful.  It constantly alarmed in the middle of the night that is lost camera signal but would never do it during the day in the same position and room as it was at night.  It never kept time.  I had to reset it everyday and it would revert back to a time 6-8 hrs off in the evenings.  To their credit, Motorola customer support is wonderful.  They tried as best they could troubleshoot even sending me a new parent monitor and eventually a whole new system but, the new system had the same problems including not being able to keep time as the original one I bought.  Their return policy however is frustrating.  They will not send out a replacement piece until the original has proven that it has shipped.  So while they did send me a new system in effort to resolve the issues I had no way of monitoring my children for almost a week.  I returned the this system and purchased Motorola MBP38S-2 and it works like a charm so far.  Please save yourself the time, frustration and lack of sleep and do not buy this monitor."
"2956","1","Well, where do I begin?  Everything about this monitor  is a piece of crap.  The charger doesn<U+2019>t stay in the port, the actual monitor barely holds a full charge, the screen constantly freezes and then is super jumpy when it does start moving. I hate this thing. Save your money and don<U+2019>t buy it."
"2957","2","This was great while it worked. As a few others have mentioned, however, after a few months the base stopped connecting with the monitor or the picture from the camera would freeze, which rendered the monitor almost completely useless. They shipped out a replacement, but I was without a monitor for 7 days in the meantime. SO, SO frustrating.  I will be honest, I did not do too much research into monitors, but there HAS to be a better option than this, especially for the money."
"2958","1","I have never left a review on anything. I wanted this product for the app so I could look with my phone. Doesn't work. I have 60 mb/s intnernet. One of the best routers and this piece of expensive plastic doesn't connect. I do networking and computer repair for a living. Please don't waste your money on motorolas turd. Thank you."
"2959","1","Bought this monitor when it was $300.Stopped working after less than a year. The video freezes constantly. My daughter almost fell off the bed because the video froze and we didn't see she was awake. Wayyyy to expensive for what you get."
"2960","1","Just opened the monitor out of the box and the sound is terrible. It sounds like it has blown speakers already and there's a crackle noise constantly. I did buy the two year warranty bc monitors seem to go out but after reading reviews I think I'll just take back before the headache kicks in."
"2961","2","The picture isn't very clear and it won't zoom out far enough or pan down far enough to be placed anywhere actually on the crib.  The buttons on the parent unit can't be locked so you can't stick it in your pocket - and who stays in one room all the time while the baby is sleeping?  I've had to reset it several times due to lockup issues. Wish I could return this but the box was thrown away.  Very Disappointed!"
"2962","5","We love this monitor - the picture is very clear and can be viewed from anywhere. We have not had any trouble connecting - especially when connected to a wifi network.  We have two android phones and an Ipad and setting up the app/connecting to the camera was easier and faster with android but it does work with all three.  I really like that anyone we give the password to can sign in from their own phone around the country (grandparents, etc) and not have to have a specific separate receiver to view.  All the features - two way sound, temperature, night vision, remote movement, etc work great with the app."
"2963","3","I purchased this product last week, as I liked that this product has remote viewing, so I could log into the application and view what is going on at home, while I am at work. We bought this product at a store, and it was the only one on display that had this function. For this reason, we had planned on purchasing another camera, and placing it in our living room, so we could view what is happening in multiple rooms while we are at work.The camera advertises remote HD if capable on the device's display. I know my phone is capable of this. I can certainly tell you that the camera is NOT HD, and the image quality frequently blurs slightly and then clears. This happens on both of our phones. It is a little better on the actual monitor, but not the best quality on the mobile application. It works well enough to see what our baby is doing, but don't have high hopes for the image quality of the camera. I also logged into a computer to view the feed, and the computer image quality is the same as the mobile application. The night vision works well, and I have not had issues being able to see what is going on at night.I enjoy that you can talk using the camera, and that the camera plays music. The music is not necessarily something I would pick out, but it isn't terrible. I haven't noticed a great delay in using the camera to speak into the room. There is a small image delay to the monitor base (maybe 1-2 seconds), and a little longer on the mobile application. This is not an issue for me, as I think this is expected.The pan feature on the camera is awful and frustrating. This is the best way to describe it. If you push the button to go one direction, it almost always is way beyond what you want to look at. Then, you hit the button to go back, and it takes you beyond where you started. There is not consistency in how long the camera moves when you push the button once, both on the monitor and in the mobile application. I find myself getting VERY frustrated trying to center the crib on the screen.The monitor base seems to function as expected. I have not had issues with connectivity, but we have a smaller house. I know the range is large, but honestly, if I am going to go outside, I would not take the base with me, I would use the mobile application. I like the temperature gauge on the monitor. It seems to be accurate to a few degrees to the actual temperature in the house. This is a nice feature to have.The mobile application was difficult to set up. My fianc<U+00E9> and I both created our own accounts. When I would connect the camera to one account, the camera would disappear from the other. I did this four times back and forth between accounts before I realized that I should leave the camera in one account, and share log in information. For this reason, she uses my email and password for her application. Also, I tried many times to update the firmware version on the camera, and kept giving me error messages. I see that it is now up to date, but I did not update it. We also did have issues with the mobile application showing the image for one person and not the other. For example, I checked the camera while we were out, and on my phone the camera was offline. I opened the application on her phone, and had no problems. I also have not used to camera or video functions within the application, because again, the camera quality is not good enough to use the photos.Overall, this product is just OK. I am not in love with it, nor do I hate it. I wish I had spent some more time researching options and reading reviews, and we could have avoided some of these issues."
"2964","1","Will not take a charge after several months. Have to hold the power cord in place or use tape. Randomly turns off. My baby has been screaming upstairs and I didn't know because the monitor was off. I didn't turn it off; I was in bed asleep! Very disappointed in this product."
"2965","1","If I could leave a -star review I would this camera was great for a couple months, now the camera work occasionally and customer service will not stand behind the product. If your considering this product, please listen, I never ever write reviews,  but this porduct is so terrible I could not tell others"
"2966","1","Avoid this at all costs. Video would constantly drop out with just sound. Sometimes we would get video but no audio. Could never get this to connect to my WiFi. The menu interface on the monitor is many times unresponsive.Bottom line is I don't feel comfortable at all using this product to monitor my child in any way."
"2967","4","I haven't had any issues for connection to wireless or freezing. I have really enjoyed this monitor. I would love to be able to access the music from the babies room or by remote without the main video connection part of the monitor. I have to go into my room and turn music on before I can lay down my baby for a nap or bed."
"2968","1","We bought this monitor because we found a good deal on it, it had features we liked, and at the time it had mostly favorable reviews.After buying it (and putting up with it for 7 months) I can say this is complete trash and a waste of money.1st Problem: Our screen unit continually malfunctions and thinks we are pressing buttons when we are nowhere near it. Every time you push a button the unit beeps (no way to turn this off) so we are regularly awoken by continuous beeping at night. I mitigated this slightly by placing Scotch tape over the buttons (touch sensitive, not mechanical) to reduce their sensitivity. It helped but didn't fix the problem.2nd Problem: After 5 months or so the connectivity of the camera began to fail. Nothing in our house has changed but all of a sudden it cannot keep a constant connection to the screen unit or to the iOS app.So basically instead of a baby monitor we now own a very expensive alarm that goes off at random times throughout the day and night. This product is almost completely useless."
"2969","1","DONT BUY THIS MONITOR!It<U+2019>s been terrible since the day we got it. The picture is not great and the connections frayed and stopped charging the monitor after less than a year after we got it. Have to replace it already and will not be getting the same thing for sure. Happy to see it go."
"2970","1","I wish I could give this camera no stars!! We have done everything to troubleshoot and nothing works.We even bought a warranty and don't have the receipt so Motorola wont honor the warranty!!Horrible, horrible product and HORRIBLE customer service. We will never buy a single thing from Motorola again."
"2971","5","I like everything about this baby monitor. I looked into other options like the canary and Nest products but settled on this one because it actually is a baby monitor first and foremost. They provide a radio frequency based monitor to be kept at the bedside and you can download the app when you want to monitor the baby remotely. Love the fact that you can pan, check the temperature and talk. Everything worked right out of the box....after I followed the instructions. I see people complaining that it beeps every minute....that is because there is an option to cycle between all cameras and the unit beeps when it does not detect camera 2....you need to lock it on camera 1 to make it stop doing that. There is a way to do that READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. I have used it to monitor an elderly family member while we were away on vacation as well. I have carried it to another house and set it up to monitor my baby. the app makes it really easy to set up."
"2972","1","I bought this mainly because I wanted to use my iPhone with it. The Hubble App is garbage. It takes about 6 or 7 attempts to connect the camera to your wifi network and even then the connection is spotty (it's not my internet service as everything else in this house works just fine). So now we only use the handheld monitor with disconnects from the camera every 2 or 3 minutes and takes about 2 minutes to reconnect. LO's bedroom shares a wall with ours so it's not out of range."
"2973","1","I bought this for my baby and I had to replace for 3 times in less than 4 months of using it!!! The parent unit couldn't pair with the camera and after replacing it, the last one pairs to the camera, however the buttons don't respond to the commands properlly. I am trying a downgrade, because I think the no touch model may be better.... It is too expensive for what it delivers..."
"2974","1","Sound stopped working after 2 months and battery life is very short, even when fully charged."
"2975","2","Will not connect to Wi-Fi and the parent unit quit working after using less than 6 months.  Customer support from Motorola is slim to none.  Have been waiting over 12 days now for a resolution.  All they have told me is they do not give refunds.  I do not recommend this product."
"2976","1","WHYYYY did this already break? 1 year old. Come on. Trying to sort through a recall or return when it is gifted on our baby registry.Never could get the wifi to phone option to work. Monitor runs out of batteries, but that's not a big deal. Sound no longer works. Problem."
"2977","1","If I could give it zero stars I would. Here I sit at 4am after the camera decided to disconnect itself AGAIN. I can not tell you how many times I have been awakened by the loud beeping of the handset saying the base unit was no longer connected. We have had nothing but problems with the App not working, the base unit randomly disconnecting, the handheld unit not working. The customer service is awful and slow. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!! I've had to use a backup audio monitor since the first month of installing this camera, which completely defeats the point."
"2978","5","This is a top notch camera set up.  I have no idea what it is shoeboxed as a ""baby monitor"" - it is so much more.Networking is VERY easy.  You just have to download the iphone app and setting up this camera on your existing wifi network could not be easier.  There are no router settings to adjust or port forwarding messes to get involved in.  You do NOT need a degree from MIT to do this.The picture is very clear - the best of any camera I have used.You get two way audio AND a reasonably accurate temp sensor.You can customize movement or temp alerts.The handheld screen is a nice bonus (but is not necessary if you use the iPhone app).  The screen is thin, small and crystal clear.  The battery does not last very long though (the only negative thing I have to say about this product.)The pan/tilt works quite well too and it doesn't make a lot of noise when it moves (so, if you are using this as a baby monitor, it won't wake the baby.)"
"2979","1","This is the most annoying thing in our house. I hate this monitor. We thought it would be nice to have 2 cameras and 1 monitor for our twins. One camera is always on the fritz-- we can never have both connected and functional for >2 hours. A lot of resetting, unplugging, and reconfiguring. And the website is ZERO help.  It's like the want to erase the memory of this piece of sh*t as much as I do.  Pick another model if you're considering this one."
"2980","5","I love this monitor. Don't understand the bad reviews. It has good connection in my large 2 story home. Colors are clear in bright when there is light in the room but I try to keep it dark so I usually see a lot of the night vision which works well. There hasn't been a delay since I bought it a week ago."
"2981","1","If you want to hear your baby cry do not purchase this monitor!We switched from this $300 monitor to our $120 travel monitor and it works 1000 times better than this system.Our cheap monitor pickes up the slightest sounds and movement  and this $300 monitor only worked if she was crying very loudly which we then just heard the cries through the wall"
"2982","1","Gigantic POS!!! Do not waste your money.  Camera will not stay connected to screen and have to manually reset the camera EVERY NIGHT!  Completely worthless.  Highly recommend buying anything besides Motorola is this is the quality of product they put out.  Will not buy Motorola product again."
"2983","1","We bought this monitor last December but started using two weeks ago when our baby transitioned to his crib in his own bedroom.First week it worked great. Second week it started restarting on its own, then weird static noises and finally I can't hear any thing from my baby's room. Terrible product. DO NOT BUY IT."
"2984","1","First the sound stopped working then it wouldn't connect to our phones! Returning this ASAP! Also had other friends return it to!"
"2985","1","We purchased the Motorola MBP853CONNECT-2 Digital Video Baby Monitor with Wi-Fi Internet Viewing and 2 Cameras, and right from the start it could only hold a charge for 5 min. We contact Motorola, and they sent us a new parental unit. Unfortunately, the only way they would do this is by placing a hold on our credit card, and we had to pay to ship the original back to them before the hold was lifted. Once we tried the new monitor and camera, the monitor worked, but the camera night vision did not.We lost confidence in the Motorola brand, and did not want to pay for shipping again, so we returned it. I contacted Motorola to complain that the shipping, effort and time required to correct the issue was unacceptable. They did not seem to care, and kept giving a standard response that there was nothing they could do. I will never buy Motorola again. We instead purchased a new Samsung monitor, and it works great!"
"2986","1","I rarely write reviews, but this is an AWFUL monitor. Expensive and malfunctions often. NOT worth the money. I received this monitor as a gift for my baby shower and I have had constant issues with it. I have even used the warranty a couple times, but each time I get a piece of junk."
"2987","2","Would be great if the sound on the parent unit didn't stop working 6 months after we started using it. It's still registering sound with the flashing lights, but the speaker isn't transmitting sound.  Paid nearly $200 for it a year for it to be worthless now that we're actually trying to get our baby to sleep in her own room"
"2988","1","Waste of money and baby was left awake a few times because this did not work. Avoid! Does not serve it's purpose as a monitor. Screen does not turn on when motion or sound is detected, you have to manually keep refreshing the screen. We didn't know this at first and baby was quietly waiting in bed. Buttons make very loud noises which does not work well for nighttime viewing with a sleeping spouse. Concept its nice, but execution is horrible. Tried for a week and could not stand to use this ""monitor."" Listen to the reviews on this one!"
"2989","4","I have owned the summer infant and this camera we had to get as now we have two kids.Pros -ability to see room Temperature2 way talkmusic controlszoom and move featuresConsDelay of 1 to 2 secssound is not picked up well . We got used to our summer infant sound and light gage from green to red depending on how much the baby is yelling.cant find a protective case for it anywhere its big and afraid I will drop it and it will break"
"2990","1","This is by far the worst model ever!!!!  DO NOT spend your money on this!  The night vision you cannot see anything at all!  It is just all pixels!  See my attached photo. The touch screen is awful.  You have to hit 3 different buttons to turn off the screen as it is so bright.  Problem is the noise wakes up you significant other or baby!  The monitor lights up again when it senses movement, but unless you touch the screen it will be stuck on the previous picture of your little one....so again more noise and annoyance.  Absolutely not worth the money.  Motorola is being good about it and replacing it.  They do need to pull this thing off the shelves, there are too many issues with this thing."
"2991","3","It was great while it's working. We liked it because we can leave the base with our babysitter, and still able to check the baby with our phones. We are also able to ""talk"" to our baby while being away. It lasted two years. One day, it just won't connect anymore. If it lasted longer, I would give it a 5-star."
"2992","1",""
"2993","2","Definitely not worth the money. 1st unit would not stay connected to camera. We had 2 cameras, but only one was the issue. Customer service replaced entire monitor and camera set, but new unit would not keep time properly and the right arrow button was unresponsive at times. We'll see if they replace on the 3rd go around. One plus is new unit monitor had buttons that illuminate. Great for night time. Old unit, though exactly the same did not. Phone app not great either, but was not critical for our use."
"2994","5","I really don't understand the low ratings. We've had ours for a year and a half and its been great! No issues."
"2995","1","I had a cheaper model Motorola and had issues with the charging port so I returned and paid extra for this one. Well I thought i upgraded . However the picture quality was worse than the cheaper one, and it constantly lost connection with the camera. So all night it start beeping lost connection.. Id restart it and it would have 4 bars ! Worse baby monitor !"
"2996","1","It<U+2019>s junk. The unit continuous to disconnect from the camera. Also the app is unreliable. Going to replace it with another brand and I can<U+2019>t wait to smash this with a hammer.However Motorola<U+2019>s customer service is awesome."
"2997","1","Worked great for 2 months.  Then the sound stopped working,  like so many other reviews say. Save yourelf the grief and don't buy in the first place !!!!! Very disappointed."
"2998","1","This is the biggest piece of garbage. I thought something was wrong with the first one I purchased. But the one I exchanged for is the same piece of junk! In both, the monitor went out within a month. So I can't even use it without the app. But it won't work on my iPad or iPhone. It only SOMETIMES works on my husbands samsung note 4. What good does this do me? Please, no one purchase this. This was the second most expensive at babies r us so I assumed it was the best. Definitely wrong."
"2999","1","The product is actually very good, and at my first try, it was perfect - but in the first month of using it stopped working (does not turn on) and I have not found a way to fix it - even though it has warranty, I cannot find technical assistance in Brazil.I am still trying to contact Motorola for a solution, hopping to solve this situation."
"3000","1","We have had so many issues with this camera and have been trying to work with customer service to receive a replacement for the past two months and it has become a huge time waster.  The night vision image quality is awful, there is a blinking blue light on the camera that keeps baby awake, there is a delay when trying to tilt the camera, the buttons on our unit never illuminated correctly. Customer service has been awful."
"3001","3","The monitor has a very short life for battery and the night vision is not very good. Hard to see where our baby is in the crib when night vision mode is on. Gets a pretty good range for distance. It<U+2019>s an okay monitor for the cost."
"3002","2","Great features but the thing never works! I'm on my second one and I continuously have problems connecting, losing sound, overheating and it seems to be impossible to get two phone connected to the app."
"3003","1","Worst baby monitor you can buy. Motorola is notorious for their bad baby monitor products. When the audio on our monitor stopped working after 6 months, the Motorola representative told us that it happens ALL THE TIME. They also would not replace or repair. Save your money and buy something else!"
"3004","1","Do not buy this monitor. It is garbage. The sound randomly stops working, the pan and tilt stop working all the time, sometimes just won't connect to the camera, bad picture, the app rarely works... I could go on and on. Just spend less money on a monitor system that works."
"3005","4","This monitor is very feature packed. I prefer physical buttons but the touch ones aren't too bad. The smartphone features are an added bonus. The big con is turning the screen off. You have to do 3 touch button presses just to accomplish this. NOT fun in the early hours when you just want to get back to sleep. There is a physical sleep/wake button on the top but it tells you the screen is locked when trying to turn it off."
"3006","1","Awful product. The power cords for both the mobile viewer and the camera often do not work. The camera consistently goes offline, and we<U+2019>ve given up on using the mobile viewer as a result. If you<U+2019>re looking for a functional baby monitor, look somewhere else."
"3007","2","if i could take it back I could. i got it as a gift because we registered for it. it has been terrible. it works only occasionally for max 5-10 minutes. if you think this is going to be a baby monitor that will sustain the connection, it won't. the site is down almost 1 a day and you have to refresh to make it work.i would be better off with a traditional baby monitor."
"3008","1","Concept = Good, Execution = PoorThe features on this Motorola were great but they don't actually work. I had an old Motorola that we used for 3 years.  We had a second child and needed an add'l camera so we bought this new MBP854 new camera.  The touch screen is too sensitive.  I try to pan the camera and it either doesn't work or starts turning all the way until I can't see my child anymore.  Also, the sound quality is poor, at best. I bought two cameras thinking the first was a lemon but found both to be of the same poor quality.  Too bad.  I like the brand and wanted to stick with it.  DON'T BUY!"
"3009","1","I bought one 1.5 years ago and it worked perfect. The unit just died though. It would no longer charge. The plug in attached to baby monitor was always a very tight fit. I bought another one and the night vision is awful! I can't see anything just a black screen. And there was plenty of light in the room. With my old one it could be pitch dark and the night vision worked great. Takes forever to link up and the tilt and zoom have an awful long delay. Returned it and the second one is just as bad. Motorola needs to work on these lemons."
"3010","1","I am one not one that usually takes the time to write up reviews, and I usually don't have alot of complaints about the things I buy as I do a significant amount of research on them before purchasing. Unfortunately, I wish I'd opted NOT to put this particular monitor on my baby registry and I wish I had the option to give this zero stars. This monitor was the newest model at the time we were looking at monitors, and back in February/March when we added it to our registry there were limited reviews on the product but all were positive. Despite that, Motorola was a trusted company and we ended up chosing this one because we liked the features it offered.I ended up receiving this as a gift from my brother at my baby shower. We were excited to have it, and as it got closer to time for the baby to arrive we completed the nursery and set the monitor up for use. We used it maybe 5 times, for less than 15 minutes, almost all exclusively for the purpose of setting up the monitor, because the baby is still sleeping in our room. This past weekend, we decided to try to work on transitioning her to her crib during naps and once we had her laid down in the nursery, to our shock, the monitor screen would not turn on. Not only would it not turn on, but it also would not react to the charger being plugged in. No matter what we did, it simply would not respond at all. Talk about adding extra stress to an already anxious new mom!After calling Motorola and being advised they were closed until Tuesday, we called Amazon. The nicest lady on their registry team talked with me and shipped out a replacement monitor, next day, for us. (I wish I could give Amazon customer support five stars - they are excellent).The new monitor arrived next day, as promised, and we set it up and charged the screen for the recommended 16 hours. When I went in to grab the (new) monitor, I noticed that it looked like it wasn't charging. Confused, I pushed the power button to power it on. The monitor turned on, but froze at the MOTOROLA loading screen and just sat there. Nothing we did would get it to move from the load screen. We couldn't even power it off! We ended up having to take the battery out to shut it down. I thought to myself ""what kind of cruel joke is this!"" we returned a monitor that wouldn't turn on and now we have one that won't shut off!After trying to trouble shoot it for over an hour, we gave up. Even if we got the monitor to work, I absolutely would not feel safe using it after the experience of two brand new, barely/never used monitors malfunctioning. Back to the phone I went to contact the, once again excellent, Amazon customer service team. I explained the issue with the second monitor and asked if I could simply return it and get a credit, since the monitor was a gift, so that I could purchase a different monitor as I did not want to try a third replacement of this monitor.We are now sending this back and after putting in some additional research, I will be ordering an Infant Optics DXR-8 Video Baby Monitor to replace this one. As much as it was a negative (and stressful!) experience to have a brand new gift not work (and for the replacement to also malfunction) I'm rather glad we discovered the problems when we did, rather than while using it and realize in the middle of the night one night that it was broken.I don't know if we just had bad luck - but after this experience I would not recommend or purchase a Motorola monitor for anyone having a baby."
"3011","1","Can I give this thing infinitely negative stars.Seriously. For a company that makes solid tech gear this is like their ugly step child that they should keep locked in a very dark and damp place until it beeps itself to a dead battery (which would probably only take about an hour or so).You don't even have to touch the soft buttons, get within two inches of one and it accepts as a touch!I am sitting here at about 11p listening to it beep wondering if 1) it will ever stop beeping , 2) I will get some sleep , and 3) should I just throw it in the garbage disposal and sleep on my kiddos floor for the night and get a new one tomorrow"
"3012","1","We bought a MBP85Connect just six months ago, and the camera is dead.  No bluetooth or wifi connection at all.  For the over $300 we paid for it, we'd hoped to get more than just 6 months use out of it.  Now it's a paperweight and a replacement camera for our baby monitor is $149????  This is ridiculous.  I have a 6 month old baby and a useless $300 monitor.  Motorola, if you read these reviews, please contact me to make this right."
"3013","4","I do t know how parents can go without a video monitor! This us the only I've used so I can't compare it to others, but I love that I can keep an eye on my little one, I love that it has a room temperature too! That has saved me many times from having to sneak in and see if it's too hot or too cold in the room. The battery lasts a long time and I live that it has a low battery alert in case I forget to plug it in over night."
"3014","4","Reading through the reviews, it looks like people are reviewing different models. The one I'm looking at is the camera only and about $150. Half the reviews talk about it costing $300 and the bad monitor. This model has no monitor, just the camera."
"3015","2","It works, mostly. But for this price point it is an extremely cheap product. The buttons on the monitor unit are not lit, so you cannot see them in the dark, period. The controls to move the camera are very unresponsive; sometimes taking 10-15 seconds before it registers. The audio and video are decent enough, about what you would expect from a monitor. If this unit were around $100 I would definitely recommend. But I would avoid at the $300 price point."
"3016","1","Trash.  Night vision is worthless.  You can barely see anything. Sound goes in and out. So sometimes you can't see or hear.  $200+ should be better in every category, but no. Don't waste your money on this."
"3017","1","Poorly made connector! 3 months of use and its already breaking..The night screen video quality is a joke too! Don't waste your money!"
"3018","5","I have tried all the motorola baby monitors and this is by far the best one.  The ability to use it like a dropcam with notifications, recordings, and away on wifi is amazing.  If you are used to the old models you will notice the sound is better but the volume should be kept higher bc it doesn't pick up ambient noise as well.  It picks up the baby noise perfectly though.  Also only con is the blue status light -but i covered it with a small piece of black tape so problem solved."
"3019","2","It worked 4 months for us and fizzed out.The app never worked on our phone, which was the reason I bought this product."
"3020","5","This monitor is amazing. The picture and sound are both great. You can simply adjust all features. I have it set up in my playroom and can easily communicate with my kids via the monitor. It spans the entire room. It is simple to use without even reading the instructions and the technology is top notch. This monitor has been life changing because I can be productive around the house while my boys play!"
"3021","1","Terrible product! Picture quality is poor and would go to night mode with lights in the room turned on. Monitor screen unit lost connection with camera unit and unrecoverable after 2 weeks and then proceeded to die a week later. Unfortunately we received this is as a gift so no return possible. Will not be replacing this defective product with anything Motorola in the future!"
"3022","1","You think spending this much on a monitor would get you the best quality, I am all ready on my second one because the first one would freeze and just shut down randomly, now the second one only displays voice and the camera does not work, now nothing works. Called customer service and they said they have been having issues and that they would not refund me but just keep sending me new ones until one works. This is not only extremely frustrating but seems like a hazard with a newborn infant, sometimes it shows her I. The picture long after I have picked her up and sometimes it shows her not in the picture long after I have put her down, it's completely unreliable and I do not recommend this monitor"
"3023","5","This monitor is easy to use. We especially find the remote pan/zoom feature helpful, depending on where our little one has situated herself in her crib. After using this, I would never purchase a monitor without a WIFI viewing feature - which is very convenient and comforting when I'm away from home.Overall, for the cost, we couldn't ask for a better monitor."
"3024","1","Crap. Returned after it disconnected and was unable to reconnect despite all attempts. Replaced with a Samsung, so far much better all around."
"3025","1","Freezes or completely stops working with every used after 6 months of use. Very frustrating!"
"3026","1","6 months, and now the monitor will not respond AT ALL. Also, calling this HD is ridiculous, even in the highest light situations there is nothing high-def about this unit. This is the second Motorola baby monitor that has crapped out on me. SUCH a disappointment."
"3027","1","I cannot believe someone gave this product 5 starts. Some of the features are good like having an app so I can watch from anywhere, or playing a melody from the camera in the room. No features make up for Howe awful the picture quality is. So disappointed with this product :("
"3028","1","I would give 0 stars if I could. I haven't had this monitor a year and have already had it replaced twice and it is broken again. Save your money and buy a different product."
"3029","4","Okay, I'm impressed. The monitor and camera do a great job and controlling the camera from the handheld monitor is way cool. The ability to watch from my iPhone is nice too. The only problem is I can't get it to work over data on my iPhone 5. Within the wi fi range it's good, and I can even control the camera using the app. The picture is good and I love that the sound is better than I thought too.This is a handy device, I recommend it."
"3030","1","Audio failed after 4 months AND battery life terrible"
"3031","1","By far the worst monitor. I am currently sitting here working on my FORTH monitor, as the power ports have all failed. I have Motorolas baby monitor support number saved in my phone I call them so much. Now, even with the new monitor, it just stopped connecting to the camera!"
"3032","2","Weak. Frequent disconnects and the application it comes with is total garbage and very poorly designed."
"3033","1","DO NOT BUY MOTOROLA!  They will go out on you every two years, and they have terrible customer service!  It is not a reliable baby monitor!"
"3034","1","i had very high hopes for this monitor, considering it is a pricey ""top of the line"" one.However, this monitor beeps throughout the night. It does so when updating the firmware and when out of range. My last monitor was never ever out of range, we live in a small house, and have very high speed internet. I have also pushed updates to the camera during the day to avoid it doing so during the night.It still beeps. Often on and off for an hour.I returned it and bought another one, and that one did the same thing. How is anyone else not experiencing this problem?! It's not acceptable! On the off Chance my son actually sleeps, I don't need something else waking me up! Returning it sadly, and in the hunt for another one.Update: I spoke with Motorola today and this is apparently a very common problem. I was told to update the firmware and call back tomorrow. I already did that yesterday and it still beeped last night."
"3035","1","Beeps all of a sudden as if it's not connected. And the cord connects break or bend  so you can't connect the device to a power cord. Do not buy!!"
"3036","3","Dear seller , I bought this camera in July last year and recently the display is not getting out of energy . Before it worked perfectly on drums."
"3037","1","Worst monitor ever."
"3038","1","Horrible experience!!! Sound went out on the parent unit 6 months after purchasing. Doesnt hold a charge and always having trouble connecting to camera. Waste of my money!"
"3039","1","Confusing to pair and set up- takes foreverBad night visionGoes out at random times (in the middle of the night sometimes) and starts beeping.Once it goes out I can't figure out why and it is a mystery when I get it working again"
"3040","1","Returning it today. The monitor has a timer to shut off the video, but the screen turns on randomly and drains the battery. The video resolution is terrible. And the pan function moves the camera so far with each push of the button, it's barely controllable. In short, it's the most expensive unit I saw, but the quality is mediocre at best."
"3041","1","Don't have much to say other than don't buy this product.  Riddled with software and hardware issues; these issues are all over the internet.  You are wasting your time and money buying this plastic toy."
"3042","2","It's the MOTN and I can't see my baby because them monitor just keeps trying to load. My app says that the camera is offline. The app is a cool concept but if none of it works, what is the point?"
"3043","2","Expensive price tag for a monitor that has tons of issues. The good, it has a long range. The bad, it is insanely problematic.Our the charger does not fit in snugly, so it takes a good bit of intentional effort to get it in there and make sure it is actually charging. We often plug it in, only to find that it is not actually charging. And when we really need it, it is dead. Also will plug it in at night before bed and have it start beeping at 3am b/c it wasn't charging an is dying! Super annoying, especially when every bit of sleep counts with a newborn.Also our is constantly disconnecting itself from the camera every time we turn it on. Nothing more annoying than putting a sleepy baby down, and having to sneak back in there to manually reset the camera.Do yourself a favor. Don't buy!"
"3044","5","Love this monitor! Received as a baby gift, and is awesome. I love that I can view on my phone as well. It also has the night vision infrared that is very clear. I can also change the angle which is very useful. I can not say enough good things about this monitor. There is nothing else I would ask for out of a monitor."
"3045","1","Worst monitor ever. Worked great for about 2 months, and then the power cord to the monitor no longer held a charge without being duct taped in a certain way. Called customer support and they are zero help. We are ordering a new monitor."
"3046","1","Terrible!! These monitors basically stop working after a few days! On my second warranty replacement and it just stopped working. I literally had it for two days.  The first camera sound stopped after three months, the second set won't connect. Do not buy! Waste of money and time!!"
"3047","2","The monitor worked for about 9 months and then gave out. I would not recommend this product. Very frustrating especially when you have an infant."
"3048","1","The camera is OK, but the Hubble app is a nightmare.it is not possible to trust its connection when you out of the house.. !the app is an amateur level. Motorola should be ashamed of themselves for it"
"3049","1","Terrible monitor- we had an older version of the same model and loved it. Had to return because one of the microphones wasn't working. Got this because it was the newest model of the same monitor and was so disappointed- the sound was super low and would barely pick up our two children's voices unless it was right by their face. The picture quality was poor and very delayed. The battery hardly held a charge and that was all on the first day. We bought this at a ""big baby store"" and returned it within 24 hours- the lady at the counter said we were the third couple that day to return the ridiculously overpriced monitor just in her shift. Was very excited to have two cameras and wifi because usually you can't get both... Very disappointed!"
"3050","1","This camera is absolutely terrible! You can only pair 1 phone to it WHEN THERE ARE 2 PARENTS MOTOROLA!!!! The camera movement works awful and there is a half second of alert with no notification on the app. I could not be more disappointed, especially considering how expensive it is. I would definitely not recommend this product to ANYONE!!!"
"3051","1","It just doesn't work! Shows 10 to 20 minutes and the image freezes and then it loses signal. Deeply unsatisfied with this product."
"3052","3","The sound is a kind of low, and I was really desappointed when I realized I had to pay monthly for the app service in my phone"
"3053","1","Very poor internet connection, moniter freezes very frequently, the firmware has to be updated all the time requiring you to reinstall the camera, limited 1 year warranty only if you save your receipt and HORRIBLE customer service"
"3054","2","Would be great if the app worked all of the time.  The app would freeze for 20+ minutes at a time.  Countless night of the app being frozen and woke up to my baby crying for who knows how long.  I returned it and searching for a new one.."
"3055","1","I<U+2019>ve been using this monitor for almost 3 months, and the cable connected to the camera is not working anymore, it<U+2019>s not making contact."
"3056","1","<U+00A0><U+00A0>If I could give tis zero stars I would. I felt compelled to warn soon to be parents about this AWFUL PRODUCT.  Honestly, having NO baby monitor would be better than having this piece of junk.  Firstly, after only a few months of use, the speakers stopped working. A phone call to customer service and they showed me how to reset the camera fixed it BUT it kept happening and when you turn the screen off the parent unit makes this OBSCENELY LOUD beeping noise which is really annoying at 3am when you are already an exhausted parent. Also, resetting the camera at 3am is also very disturbing as you have to go into the babies room and wake them up as the camera says ""READY FOR PAIRING"" every time you have to do this. Secondly, the parent unit regularly cannot find the camera unit and BEEPS loudly when it can't find it...and when I say regularly I mean 1-3 times a day. Thirdly, the microphone stopped working on the camera and I had to get a new camera sent to me. But customer service sent a home security camera instead of a baby monitor camera...............which BEEPS IN THE BABY'S ROOM every time the camera gets somehow disconnected from the parent unit. Not only does the camera beep in the baby's room, but it beeps loudly on the parent unit.  Lastly, here is a photo/video from today... Only part of the screen works- it's dying a bit more every few hours.  one sixth of the screen shows my baby and another part shows her turning her head from side to side FROM A DIFFERENT TIME!!!! Also one time when my husband put her to bed, there was no baby shown on the screen! Then all the sudden she appears again?!?! WORST WORST WORST! Needless to say this is the final day that I have to use this piece of garbage and tomorrow my new Philips Avent Monitor arrives THANK GOD! I'm a first time mom and have enough to worry about, learning about my baby and trying to get her to sleep and this monitor just made my life so much more difficult than it had to be my first year."
"3057","1","The first thing I think about when I think of this monitor is to find a  Moterola factory. Find the person that invented or ok'd this device. Then ask them very politely to bend over. Then I will shove it far enough up there ass that it will become just as much of a constant pain in the ass for them as it has been for us. First of all the charging cord broke on us twice. The thing says long distances but it does not even reach my basement or backyard. We also do not have a huge house or backyard. The charge lasts about 45 min tops. Now the thing is making a constant humming noise when it is on. So I now have to turn down the sound witch makes it hard to hear my baby. I swear I have never been more disappointed in a a product. It was also not cheap witch makes me even angrier.  Maybe some prople had better luck then we did. However for us after 6 months things started going down hill fast"
"3058","1","It is difficultly connecting WIFI  and motion sensitivity is not working and PTZ is not working well.Do not buy Motorola product."
"3059","4","The Motorola Baby monitor is AWESOME!!!  When those grand babies come for a visit you can see and hear them from another room...when you are nervous after not having any babies in the house for a long time, this is the trick YOU want to have available to you.  My baby monitor came from Amazon and I love it!!  Even if there is no baby to check on it is fabulous if you have someone who is sick and needs more attention...also for the elderly who might be living with you, it is an awesome tool to let you check on them.  Get yours and feel safer with the baby, a sick person or the elderly."
"3060","1","Horrible picture, muffled sound, beeps and flashes for no reason. Do not waste your money!!!!"
"3061","2","The app works as advertised.  It was easy to set up and connect the camera to my WiFi system.  However, I just could not get past the poor video quality.  Images were blocky and jerky."
"3062","3","We love the monitor but Hubble doesn't work. Had we known what we know now we would have skipped the online portion and just gotten one with the handheld monitor."
"3063","1","Straight out of the box it didn't work. Monitor would never move from the white startup screen, even while plugged in & fully charged. Motorila has no idea why. Tried everything. Piece of garbage. Will exchange for a different brand."
"3064","1","Within one month after we started using this monitor, the camera broke. Motorola sent us a new replacement unit (camera and monitor). Here we are about 6-7 months later and the monitor won't charge. I will say Motorola's customer service has been awesome. No issues getting replacement units, but the fact that this is our second replacement in less than a year is evidence that this product shouldn't be sold any longer."
"3065","2","I expected quite a bit more from a Motorola product. While the IR night video quality is good and the daytime color video is acceptable, there's not a whole lot else going for it. To boot the parent unit up, the user manual says to press and hold the power button for 1 second. This rarely works. We resort to button mashing and eventually it works. While trying to pan or tilt the camera from the parent unit, there's a huge delay and the camera only moves about 40% of the time. Often times it moves way too far because you have no way of knowing how much it will move. Then you have to try to fine tune it. There's no way to turn the video feed off while the parent unit it plugged in and charging. This is really dumb. If we forget to charge it but need to use it at night as a good ol' fashioned audio monitor, we're stuck with a bright screen lighting up the room. The sound level LEDs only light up when our son is extremely unhappy - there's no subtly to their response and therefore we must watch the screen to tell if he's losing his cool. The volume control is awful, you must press the button once to just view what level it's on and then again if you want to change the level. I'm never curious what level it's on, I just want to change the level immediately. The kick stand on the back is awful. It makes a very loud snapping noise when you open it. You then must place it on a completely flat surface, otherwise the parent unit just falls over. We bought this because some of our friends had one and said it was OK. Other products had awful reviews but man, this thing is probably over priced by $150 for how low quality it is over all. Terrible features, things I'll never use (lullabies, seriously?) and a clunky interface makes it a losing proposition. The battery life is good, that's a plus. I'd stay away from it if I had a chance to redo my purchase."
"3066","1","Connectors as terrible. They become very loose and it makes it impossible to charge."
"3067","1","Worst baby monitor ever.Never connectsOnce connected it always disconnects and we have to re pair the monitorSo incredibly frustrating for how much this thing cost!DONT GET IT"
"3068","1","Dont buy. Low quality and so disappointing customer service. No solution for more than 6 months for a non working device"
"3069","5","It was a gift and the future parents were so happy to get it"
"3070","1","First thing I don't like about this camera is that it's very hard to find the right angel to see your baby. The camera barely points down. In my case, the baby is never even with the camera, usually the camera is sitting up higher than the baby. So I always have to have it propped up on something to aim it down. This causes an issue if you want to turn the camera because it's unstable. Second, the app is horrible. The cameras are always offline and constantly need to be unplugged and replugged to get them back online so they can be viewed. Third, the monitor that comes with the camera lasts about 1.5 hours without being plugged. The only positive thing about these are the video is pretty clear at night. I wish the app worked better because then I could deal with having to prop it up."
"3071","1","People are saying this camera is total crap. I cannot stress enough how correct they are. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA. We have had it for months before the baby was born and now 4 months old we put her in her room for the first time. Guess what tho! We can't keep an eye/ear out for her because this camera is complete crap and is constantly dropping offline. Will be searching out a better camera first thing tomorrow."
"3072","1","The worst camera or camera line ever! This was the 2nd camera of Motorola's that we purchased within 2 years and both broke within months of buying them. Customer service was a nightmare, rude and beyond unhelpful! Image quality is poor, Hubble service is a disaster. The connection of the charger cord to the camera and monitor would fail within months of owning it. The camera adjust buttons are inaccurate and the all additional added features are not helpful. A big price tag for something totally not worth the money!"
"3073","1","Not worth the money. I got this because of the dual monitoring. But it doesn't exist. I wasted my money and the app basiclly did not work well at all. So I returned this and got a different camera without Internet that works great for less money. Why pay more for something if you aren't going to get it anyway."
"3074","5","Twice the range of our old Motorola monitor.  Plus it has wifi.  The app is simple and intuitive.  The feel of the screen and camera is quality.  Possibly the perfect baby monitor."
"3075","1","This seemed like a good deal as my wife wanted a dedicated monitor with the ability to use her iphone as well.  Lot's of good features but the video quality is terrible and there is a 2-3 second lag/delay that drove us crazy.  We had one from Summer that had maybe a .5 second delay and it was $200 cheaper albeit it only lasted one year.The solution:  We ended up returning the motorola and bought a Foscam plug n play for $100.  For the dedicated monitor we ended up buying an Ipod touch for $200.  This system works 100 times better and the ipod touch is superior in every way to the cheap plastic monitor that comes with the Motorla.To sum it up:$300 for a Cheap plastic Motorola monitor with a low quality camera that has terrible lag.VS.$300 for a durable Ipod touch with the retina display and a much better camera in every way with virtually zero lag.Note:  If you don't mind buying used you can find an iPhone 5s for $200 that is far superior to the ipod touch."
"3076","1","terrible, just terrible. It simply does not work. they put a product on the market that just doesn't work, literally, at all."
"3077","5","Awesome- great product!"
"3078","1","Honestly the worst Motorola product available. Returned it and upgraded to the mbp854connect and it's much better!"
"3079","1","Do not buy this monitor. The video barely ever works. I have to turn the power on and off to get it to connect.  Sometimes the picture freezes. We don't know when we are actually watching our son or just a frozen picture. At won point my wife panicked when the picture showed an empty crib. You can imagine the fear she went thru sprinting to the nursery thinking our 2 month old boy was somehow taken from our home while she was home alone."
"3080","5","This camera was a great baby shower gift. They had forgotten all about one and now they can both hook up their phones. Supper excited"
"3081","4","It has taken me a while to write this review because I insisted on setting up the system by myself.  That wasn't the best plan as it turns out.  Frankly, I had the darndest time figuring out the system.  To be fair, that is nothing new for me, but I have learned to finally program my dvr for recordings.So if you are like me, and you have my sympathy, then this device might be tricky to set up and operate.  However, once programmed it worked well.  I don't use it for watching the baby since mine are old enough to watch themselves.  But I did want to keep an eye on the house when not at home so it works very well thus far.  I have no reason to doubt that placing it in a child's nursery wouldn't also be helpful."
"3082","1","Less than one star. This has been nothing but a headache. Reached out to Motorola and never received any response. Do not waste your money!!!"
"3083","1","poor picture.  had to return it."
"3084","1","The parent unit is so quiet that this product is unusable. I could hear my infants cries better down the staircase and hall than I could over the monitor even when turned up all the way. I don't understand how anyone could rate this as acceptable. Even 50 dollar monitors let you actually hear your baby."
"3085","5","I love the fact that I can turn the camera from the monitor so if my daughter is in a different part of the room, I can move the camer to check on her. I can also control it from the app on my smartphone as well. It is a wonderful monitor and worth getting."
"3086","1","Absolutely terrible"
"3087","1","The Hubble app on the iPhone recognizes the camera but I could not get past the ""checking connection to camera"" screen. I've wasted enough time with this product (and other Motorola products) so it's going back."
"3088","1","DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA. At first sight it appears to be a great product but EVERYTIME they update their firmware, our monitor has quite working and we have had to get them to send us a new one, usually a couple of weeks later!  If you want a reliable product (which of course you do because it's supposed to monitor your baby) do not get this camera. You'll end up needing to buy another camera once it fails and you wait for your replacement one to arrive."
"3089","1","This system has been ok, but nothing great.  After 2 months of use one of the cameras went out.  Motorola wants us to pay $150 to send back to them for repair. A baby monitor this expensive shouldn't go out!"
"3090","1","Do not buy! Stopped working after 6 months!"
"3091","5","I love this monitor, but Where can I buy the additional camera?"
"3092","1","Consistent connection problems. Disconnects in the middle of the night. If having reliable picture and audio are important to you, stay away from this."
"3093","5","Great"
"3094","4","Great monitor but if you are looking to buy additional cameras good luck! They don't exist."
"3095","1","This product is horrific and drives me insane. I have twins so needed to flick between two cameras, this product turns off by itself, beeps loudly for no reason, touch screen is super slow, one camera blinks red but the other bright blue annoying baby, but that's if it stays on at all.  Please avoid, I'm so furious I spent $300+ on this."
